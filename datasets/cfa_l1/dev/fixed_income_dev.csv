0,Which of the following best describes a convertible bond’s conversion premium?,Bond price minus conversion value,Par value divided by conversion price,Current share price multiplied by conversion ratio,,A,： A is correct. The conversion premium is the difference between the convertible bond’s price and its conversion value. ： A是正确的。转换溢价是可转换债券价格与其转换价值之间的差额。<br />
1,The benefit to the issuer of a deferred coupon bond is most likely related to:,tax management.,cash flow management.,original issue discount price.,,B,"： B is correct. Deferred coupon bonds pay no coupon for their first few years but then pay higher coupons than they otherwise normally would for the remainder of their life. Deferred coupon bonds are common in project financing when the assets being developed may not generate any income during the development phase, thus not providing cash flows to make interest payments. A deferred coupon bond allows the issuer to delay interest payments until the project is completed and the cash flows generated by the assets can be used to service the debt. ： B是正确的。递延息票债券最初几年不支付息票，但随后支付的息票要比通常情况下在其余生中支付的要高。递延息票债券在项目融资中很常见，因为开发中的资产在开发阶段可能不会产生任何收入，因此不会提供现金流来支付利息。递延息票债券允许发行人延迟支付利息，直到项目完成，资产产生的现金流可用于偿还债务。<br />"
2,A bond that is characterized by a fixed periodic payment schedule that reduces the bond’s outstanding principal amount to zero by the maturity date is best described as a:,bullet bond.,plain vanilla bond.,fully amortized bond.,,C,： C is correct. A fully amortized bond calls for equal cash payments by the bond’s issuer prior to maturity. Each fixed payment includes both an interest payment component and a principal repayment component such that the bond’s outstanding principal amount is reduced to zero by the maturity date. A and B are incorrect because a bullet bond or plain vanilla bond only make interest payments prior to maturity. The entire principal repayment occurs at maturity. ： C是正确的。完全摊销的债券要求债券发行人在到期前支付同等的现金。每笔固定支付包括利息支付部分和本金偿还部分，以便债券的未偿本金在到期日减至零。 A和B是不正确的，因为子弹债券或普通债券只在到期前支付利息。全部本金在到期时偿还。<br />
3,"When underwriting new corporate bonds, matrix pricing is used to get an estimate of the:",required yield spread over the benchmark rate.,market discount rate of other comparable corporate bonds.,yield-to-maturity on a government bond having a similar time-to-maturity.,,A,"： A is correct. Matrix pricing is used in underwriting new bonds to get an estimate of the required yield spread over the benchmark rate. The benchmark rate is typically the yield-to-maturity on a government bond having the same, or close to the same, time-to-maturity. The spread is the difference between the yield-to-maturity on the new bond and the benchmark rate. The yield spread is the additional compensation required by investors for the difference in the credit risk, liquidity risk, and tax status of the bond relative to the government bond. In matrix pricing, the market discount rates of comparable bonds and the yield-to-maturity on a government bond having a similar time-to-maturity are not estimated. Rather they are known and used to estimate the required yield spread of a new bond. ： A是正确的。矩阵定价用于承销新债券，以获得所需收益率与基准利率之差的估计值。基准利率通常是具有相同或接近相同到期时间的政府债券的到期收益率。利差是新债券到期收益率与基准利率之间的差额。利差是投资者对债券相对于政府债券的信用风险、流动性风险和税收状况差异所要求的额外补偿。 在矩阵定价中，可比债券的市场贴现率和具有类似到期时间的政府债券的到期收益率是不估计的。相反，它们是已知的，用于估计新债券所需的收益率差。<br />"
4,"Contrary to positive bond covenant, negative covenants are most likely:",costlier.,legally enforceable.,enacted at time of issue.,,A,"：A is correct. Affirmative covenants typically do not impose additional costs to the issuer, while negative covenants are frequently costly. B is incorrect because all bond covenants are legally enforceable rules, so there is no difference in this regard between positive and negative bond covenants. C is incorrect because borrowers and lenders agree on all bond covenants at the time of a new bond issue, so there is no difference in this regard between positive and negative bond covenants. ： A是正确的。肯定性条款通常不会给发行人带来额外的成本，而否定性条款通常成本高昂。B是不正确的，因为所有的债券条款都是法律上可执行的规则，所以在这方面，肯定性条款和否定性条款没有区别。C是不正确的，因为借款人和贷款人在新债券发行时就所有债券条款达成一致，因此在这方面，肯定性条款和否定性条款没有区别。<br />"
