0,"When we calculate the kurtosis, what is the power of the kurtosis?",2.,3.,4.,,C,Sample kurtosis is measured using deviations raised to the fourth power.样本峰度是用提高到四次方的偏差来测量的。<br />
1,The covariance of returns is positive when the returns on two assets tend to:,have the same expected values.,be above their expected value at different times.,be on the same side of their expected value at the same time.,,C,"： C is correct. The covariance of returns is positive when the returns on both assets tend to be on the same side (above or below) their expected values at the same time, indicating an average positive relationship between returns. ： C正确。 当两种资产的收益同时趋于同一方向(高于或低于)期望值时，收益的协方差为正，说明收益之间的平均正相关关系。<br />"
2,"For a credit card, it charges 15% compounded monthly. Its effective annual rate is closet to?",15.78%,18.85%,16.08%,,C,EAR=（1＋15%/12）^12-1=16.08%EAR=（1＋15%/12）^12-1=16.08%<br />
3,"US and Spanish bonds have return standard deviations of 0.64 and 0.56, respectively. If the correlation between the two bonds is 0.24, the covariance of returns is closest to:",0.086.,0.335.,0.390.,,A,"： A is correct. The covariance is the product of the standard deviations and correlation using the formula Cov(US bond returns, Spanish bond returns) = σ(US bonds) × σ (Spanish bonds) × ρ(US bond returns, Spanish bond returns) = 0.64 × 0.56 × 0.24 = 0.086. ： A正确。 协方差是标准差和相关系数的乘积，用以下公式计算：Cov(美国债券的回报,西班牙债券的回报)=σ(美国国债)×σ(西班牙债券)×ρ(美国债券的回报,西班牙债券的回报)= 0.64×0.56×0.24 = 0.086。<br />"
4,Which of the following is a property of two dependent events?,The two events must occur simultaneously.,The probability of one event influences the probability of the other event.,The probability of the two events occurring is the product of each event’s probability.,,B,"： B is correct. The probability of the occurrence of one is related to the occurrence of the other. If we are trying to forecast one event, information about a dependent event may be useful. 这题问：如果两个事件是dependent不独立的，以下哪个说法正确？A说：两个事件一定同时发生，翻译成数学公式就是P(AB）=100%。这句话本身是不对的。可以举一个反例。两个事件不独立，说明AB的发生是互相影响的，但是这种影响是什么未知。也有可能是A发生了B一定不发生，此时说明AB一定不能同时发生，此时AB是互斥事件，P(AB）=0.B说：一个事件会受到另外事件发生的影响，这个是dependent event的定义。dependent event是不独立事件，也就是两件事件的发生是互相影响的。C说：两件事情发生的概率是两个事件各自概率的乘积，翻译成数学公式就是P(AB）=P(A)*P(B)。只有独立事件才有P(AB）=P(A)*P(B)，这里说的是不独立事件，所以C的说法也是错误的。<br />"
