0,Which of the following institutions will on average have the greatest need for liquidity?,Banks.,Investment companies.,Non-life insurance companies.,,A,"： A is correct. The excess reserves invested by banks need to be relatively liquid. Although investment companies and non-life insurance companies have high liquidity needs, the liquidity need for banks is on average the greatest. ： 本题问，以下哪个机构对于流动性的需求最大？ 流动性需求指的是对于将手里资产变现速度的需求。银行流动性需求在三个选项中是最高的，因为银行与民生息息相关，需要预留一部分存款用于存款人的兑付。而且存款人提款需求难以预计。因此本题选择A。<br />"
1,The sum of an asset’s systematic variance and its nonsystematic variance of returns is equal to the asset’s:,beta.,total risk.,total variance.,,C,"： C is correct. The sum of systematic variance and nonsystematic variance equals the total variance of the asset. References to total risk as the sum of systematic risk and nonsystematic risk refer to variance, not to risk. ： 资产的系统方差与非系统方差之和等于资产的什么？ C是正确的。系统方差和非系统方差之和等于资产的总方差。<br />"
2,"The correlation between assets in a two-asset portfolio increases during a market decline. If there is no change in the proportion of each asset held in the portfolio or the expected standard deviation of the individual assets, the volatility of the portfolio is most likely to:",increase.,decrease.,remain the same.,,A,"： A is correct. Higher correlations will produce less diversification benefits provided that the other components of the portfolio standard deviation do not change (i.e., the weights and standard deviations of the individual assets). ： 在市场状况变差时，两个资产之间的相关系数上升。如果组合中资产占比和资产方差没有发生变化，组合的波动性会如何变化？ 本题选择A。组合的波动性即组合的方差。当资产之间相关系数上升时，组合的方差会变大。<br />"
3,"With respect to trading costs, liquidity is least likely to impact the:",stock price.,bid–ask spreads.,brokerage commissions.,,C,"： C is correct. Brokerage commissions are negotiated with the brokerage firm. A security’s liquidity impacts the operational efficiency of trading costs. Specifically, liquidity impacts the bid–ask spread and can impact the stock price (if the ability to sell the stock is impaired by the uncertainty associated with being able to sell the stock). ： 流动性最不可能影响到以下哪一项？ 本题选择C。佣金是证券公司根据投资金额按比例收取，而非根据流动性的好坏收取。 流动性的好坏会影响到交易成本，所以会影响到股票价格；流动性越好，则流动性风险越小，买卖息差越小。<br />"
4,"With respect to the capital asset pricing model, which of the following values of beta for an asset is most likely to have an expected return for the asset that is less than the risk-free rate?",-0.5,0.0,0.5,,A,"： A is correct. If an asset’s beta is negative, the required return will be less than the risk-free rate in the CAPM. When combined with a positive market return, the asset reduces the risk of the overall portfolio, which makes the asset very valuable. Insurance is an example of a negative beta asset. ： 在资本资产定价模型中，下列哪个资产的β值最有可能使该资产的预期回报率低于无风险利率？ 正确的是A。市场收益率一般大于无风险收益率。根据CAPM公式，如果资产的β系数为负，那么所需的回报率将低于CAPM中的无风险利率。<br />"
