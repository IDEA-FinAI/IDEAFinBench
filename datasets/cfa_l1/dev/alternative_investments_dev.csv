1,"Compared with direct investment in infrastructure, publicly traded infrastructure securities are characterized by:",higher concentration risk.,more-transparent governance.,greater control over the infrastructure assets.,,B,"B is correct. Publicly traded infrastructure securities, which include shares of companies, exchange-traded funds, and listed funds that invest in infrastructure, provide the benefits of transparent governance, liquidity, reasonable fees, market prices, and the ability to diversify across underlying assets. Direct investment in infrastructure involves a large capital investment in any single project, resulting in high concentration risks. Direct investment in infrastructure provides control over the assets and the opportunity to capture the assets’ full value. ：B是正确的。公开交易的基础设施证券，包括投资于基础设施的公司、交易所交易基金和上市基金，它们具有透明的治理体系、流动性、合理的费用、市场价格以及跨基础资产多样化的特征。对基础设施的直接投资涉及对单个项目的大量资本投资，将会导致高集中性的风险。对基础设施的直接投资是对资产的直接控制并且能够拥有获取资产全部价值的机会。<br />"
2,The investment method that typically requires the greatest amount of or most thorough due diligence from an investor is:,fund investing.,co-investing.,direct investing.,,C,C is correct. Due diligence in direct investing will usually be more thorough and more rigid from an investor’s perspective because of the absence of a fund manager that would otherwise conduct a large portion of the necessary due diligence. ：C是正确的。从投资者的角度来看，直接投资的尽职调查通常会更彻底、更严格，因为没有一位基金经理，否则将进行大部分必要的尽职调查。<br />
3,The majority of real estate property may be classified as either:,debt or equity.,commercial or residential.,direct ownership or indirect ownership.,,B,B is correct. The majority of real estate property may be classified as either commercial or residential.：B是正确的。大多数房地产可分为商业地产或住宅地产。<br />
4,"In comparison to other alternative investment approaches, co-investing is most likely:",more expensive.,subject to adverse selection bias.,the most flexible approach for the investor.,,B,"B is correct. Co-investing may be subject to adverse selection bias. For example, the fund manager may make less attractive investment opportunities available to the co-investor while allocating its own capital to more appealing deals.A is incorrect because co-investing is likely not more expensive than fund investing since co-investors can co-invest an additional amount alongside the fund directly in a fund investment without paying management fees on the capital that has been directly invested.C is incorrect because direct investing, not co-investing, provides the greatest amount of flexibility for the investor. B是正确的。共同投资可能受到逆向选择偏差的影响。例如，基金经理可能会向共同投资者提供吸引力较低的投资机会，同时将自己的资本分配给更具吸引力的交易。A是不正确的，因为共同投资可能不会比基金投资更昂贵，因为共同投资者可以与基金一起直接共同投资基金投资，而无需支付直接投资资本的管理费。C是不正确的，因为直接投资，而不是共同投资，为投资者提供了最大的灵活性。<br />"
