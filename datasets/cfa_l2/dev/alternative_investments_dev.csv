0,"Hui Lin, CFA is an investment manager looking to diversify his portfolio by adding equity real estate investments. Lin and his investment analyst, Maria Nowak, are discussing whether they should invest in publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) or public real estate operating companies (REOCs). Nowak expresses a strong preference for investing in public REITs in taxable accounts.Lin schedules a meeting to discuss this matter, and for the meeting, Lin asks Nowak to gather data on three specific REITs and come prepared to explain her preference for public REITs over public REOCs. At the meeting, Lin asks Nowak:“Why do you prefer to invest in public REITs over public REOCs for taxable accounts?” Nowak provides Lin with an explanation for her preference of public REITs and provides Lin with data on the three REITs shown in Exhibits 1 and 2.The meeting concludes with Lin directing Nowak to identify the key investment characteristics along with the principal risks of each REIT and to investigate the valuation of the three REITs. Specifically, Lin asks Nowak to value each REIT using four different methodologies:Method 1Net asset valueMethod 2Discounted cash flow valuation using a two-step dividend modelMethod 3Relative valuation using property subsector average P/FFO multipleMethod 4Relative valuation using property subsector average P/AFFO multiple

Nowak’s most likely response to Lin’s question is that the type of real estate security she prefers:",offers a high degree of operating flexibility.,provides dividend income that is exempt from double taxation.,has below-average correlations with overall stock market returns.,,B,"REITs are tax-advantaged entities whereas REOC securities are not typically tax-advantaged entities. More specifically, REITs are typically exempted from the double taxation of income that comes from taxes being due at the corporate level and again when dividends or distributions are made to shareholders in some jurisdictions such at the United States.<br />"

As part of the review, Tang asks Rodriguez to evaluate financing alternatives to determine if it would be better to use debt financing or to make an all cash purchase. Tang directs Rodriguez to inquire about terms with Richmond Life Insurance Company, a publicly traded company, which is an active lender on commercial real estate property. Rodriquez obtains the following information from Richmond Life for a loan on Property #1: loan term of 5 years, interest rate of 5.75% interest-only, maximum loan to value of 75%, and minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.5x.After reviewing her research materials, Rodriguez formulates the following two conclusions:Conclusion 1Benefits of private equity real estate investments include owners’ ability to attain diversification benefits, to earn current income, and to achieve tax benefits.Conclusion 2Risk factors of private equity real estate investments include business conditions, demographics, the cost of debt and equity capital, and financial leverage.
Richmond Life Insurance Company’s potential investment would be most likely described as:",private real estate debt.,private real estate equity.,publicly traded real estate debt.,,A,Richmond Life’s investment would be a mortgage which falls under private debt on the four quadrants.

Which of the following is most likely accurate regarding Property 2 described in Exhibit 1?",Operating expense risk is borne by the owner.,The lease term for the largest tenant is greater than three years.,There is a significant amount of percentage rent linked to sales levels.,,B,"The lease term for the anchor tenant is typically longer than the usual 3 to 5 year term for smaller tenants. The data in Exhibit 1 suggest that the operating expenses are passed on to the tenant; the sum of Property Management Fees and Other Operating Expenses equal the Expense Reimbursement Revenue. Also, Other Income is only $15,000 suggesting that there is a minimal amount of percentage rent linked to sales thresholds.<br />"
3,"Martha Brady is the CIO of the Upper Darby County (UDC) public employees’ pension system. Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity. She has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more information about the workings of the private equity market.Brady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity investments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major differences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from venture capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded or even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital and buyout investments.Chau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the managers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are inserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish managers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.One concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some funds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of investment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the distribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such provision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited partners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution mechanism is called the total return waterfall.Chau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the funds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits from its first three projects during a three-year period.
| Exhibit l.Investment Returns and Distribution Waterfalls |
| Private equity committed capital | $ 400 million |
| Carried interest | 20% |
| First project investment capital | $20mllon |
| Second project investment capital | $45mllon |
| Third project investment capital | $50mllon |
| Proceeds from first project | $25mllion |
| Proceeds from second project | $ 35 million |
| Proceeds from third project | $65mllon |


Chau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance of private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the awareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s life. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds, diversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years remaining to termination.
| Exhibit 2.Financial Performance of Alpha， Beta， and Gamma Funds |
| Fund | PIC | DPI | RVP I |
| Alpha | 0.30 | 0.10 | 0.65 |
| Beta | 0.85 | 0.10 | 1.25 |
| Gamma | 0.85 | 1.25 | 0.75 |


Chau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to outperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a relatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the remaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the rest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is already as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the proportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to Beta and Gamma.Hermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit from an investment is vital for the fund’s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, take special care to plan their exits.Brady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value investments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned about buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be used to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new investors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?Hermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity transactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.Statement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed on the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.Statement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary method of valuation.Statement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are used frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.
Are Chau's two reasons for interpreting Alpha Fund as the best performing fund over the remaining life correct?",No.,Yes.,"The first reason is correct, but the second reason is incorrect.",,A,"Chau misinterprets DPI, RVPI, and PIC. The returns earned to date are for each dollar of invested capital, that which has been drawn down, not total returns. Chau mistakenly believes (assuming the same management skill) the result for Alpha Fund at termination will be on the order of 3 × 0.65 = 1.95 instead of 0.65. In both cases, Alpha Fund has underperformed relative to the other two funds.<br />"
4,"Raffi Musicale is the portfolio manager for a defined benefit pension plan. He meets with Jenny Brown, market strategist with Menlo Bank, to discuss possible investment opportunities. The investment committee for the pension plan has recently approved expanding the plan's permitted asset mix to include alternative asset classes.Brown proposes the Apex Commodity Fund (Apex Fund) offered by Menlo Bank as a potentially suitable investment for the pension plan. The Apex Fund attempts to produce trading profits by capitalizing on the mispricing between the spot and futures prices of commodities. The fund has access to storage facilities, allowing it to take delivery of commodities when necessary. The Apex Fund's current asset allocation is presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l Apex Fund's Asset Allocation |
| Commodity Sector | Allocation(%) |
| Energy | 31.9 |
| Livestock | 12.6 |
| Softs | 21.7 |
| Precious metals | 33.8 |


Brown explains that the Apex Fund has had historically low correlations with stocks and bonds, resulting in diversification benefits. Musicale asks Brown, “Can you identify a factor that affects the valuation of financial assets like stocks and bonds but does not affect the valuation of commodities?”Brown shares selected futures contract data for three markets in which the Apex Fund invests. The futures data are presented in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2 Selected Commodity Futures Data* |
| Month | Gold Price | Coffee Price | Gasoline Price |
| July | 1，301.2 | 09600 | 2.2701 |
| September | 1，301.2 | 0.9795 | 2.2076 |
| December | 1，301.2 | 1.0055 | 2.0307 |


Menlo Bank recently released a report on the coffee market. Brown shares the key conclusion from the report with Musicale: “The coffee market had a global harvest that was greater than expected. Despite the large harvest, coffee futures trading activity is balanced between producers and consumers. This balanced condition is not expected to change over the next year”Brown shows Musicale the total return of a recent trade executed by the Apex Fund. Brown explains that the Apex Fund took a fully collateralized long futures position in nearby soybean futures contracts at the quoted futures price of 865.0 (US cents/bushel). Three months later, the entire futures position was rolled when the near-term futures price was 877.0 and the farther-term futures price was 883.0. During the three-month period between the time that the initial long position was taken and the rolling of the contract, the collateral earned an annualized rate of 0.60%.Brown tells Musicale that the pension fund could alternatively gain long exposure to commodities using the swap market. Brown and Musicale analyze the performance of a long position in an S&P GSCI total return swap having monthly resets and a notional amount of $25 million. Selected data on the S&P GSCI are presented in Exhibit 3.
| Exhibit 3 Selected S&PG SCI Data |
| Reference Date | Index Level |
| April(swap initiation) | 2，542.35 |
| May | 2，582.23 |
| June | 2，525.21 |


 
Which futures market in Exhibit 2 is in backwardation?",Gold,Coffee,Gasoline,,C,"When the near-term (i.e., closer to expiration) futures contract price is higher than the longer-term futures contract price, the futures market for the commodity is in backwardation. Because gasoline is the only one of the three futures markets in Exhibit 2 in which the near-term futures contract price ($1.2701) is higher than the longer-term contract price ($1.0307), the gasoline futures market is the only one in backwardation.<br />"
