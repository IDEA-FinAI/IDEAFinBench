Yeta currently does not pay a dividend, and the company operates with a target capital structure of 40% debt and 60% equity. However, on a recent conference call, Yeta's management indicated that they are considering four payout proposals:Proposal #1: Issue a 10% stock dividend.Proposal #2: Repurchase $40 million in shares using idle cash.Proposal #3: Repurchase $40 million in shares by borrowing $40 million at an after-tax cost of borrowing of 8.50%.Proposal #4: Initiate a regular cash dividend based on a residual dividend policy.
Based on Exhibit 1 and Yeta's target capital structure, the total dividend that Yeta would have paid last year under a residual dividend policy is closest to:",$77 million.,$112 million.,$175 million.,,A,<br />「huixue_img/importSubject/1475449679104839680.png」<br />「huixue_img/importSubject/1475449679176142848.png」<br />「huixue_img/importSubject/1475449679226474496.png」<br />
1,"Maximilian Bohm is reviewing several capital budgeting proposals from subsidiaries of his company. Although his reviews deal with several details that may seem like minutiae, the company places a premium on the care it exercises in making its investment decisions.The first proposal is a project for Richie Express, which is investing $500,000, all in fixed capital, in a project that will have operating income after taxes of $20,000 and depreciation of $40,000 each year for the next three years. Richie Express will sell the asset in three years, paying 30 percent taxes on any excess of the selling price over book value. The proposal indicates that a $647,500 terminal selling price will enable the company to earn a 15 percent internal rate of return on the investment. Bohm doubts that this terminal value estimate is correct.Another proposal concerns Gasup Company, which does natural gas exploration. A new investment has been identified by the Gasup finance department with the following projected cash flows:● Investment outlays are $6 million immediately and $1 million at the end of the first year.● After-tax operating cash flows are $0.5 million at the end of the first year and $4 million at the end of each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth years. In addition, an after-tax outflow occurs at the end of the five-year project that has not been included in the operating cash flows: $5 million required for environmental cleanup.● The required rate of return on natural gas exploration is 18 percent.The Gasup analyst is unsure about the calculation of the NPV and the IRR because the outlay is staged over two years.Finally, Dominion Company is evaluating two mutually exclusive projects: The Pinto grinder involves an outlay of $100,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $45,000, an after-tax salvage value of $25,000, and a three-year life. The Bolten grinder has an outlay of $125,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $47,000, an after-tax salvage value of $20,000, and a four-year life. The required rate of return is 10 percent. The net present value (NPV) and equivalent annual annuity (EAA) of the Pinto grinder are $30,691 and $12,341, respectively. Whichever grinder is chosen, it will have to be replaced at the end of its service life. The analyst is unsure about which grinder should be chosen.Bohm and his colleague Beth Goldberg have an extended conversation about capital budgeting issues, including several comments listed below. Goldberg makes two comments about real options:Comment 1“The abandonment option is valuable, but it should be exercised only when the abandonment value is above the amount of the original investment.”Comment 2“If the cost of a real option is less than its value, this will increase the NPV of the investment project in which the real option is embedded.”Bohm also makes several comments about specific projects under consideration:Comment AThe land and building were purchased five years ago for $10 million. This is the amount that should now be included in the fixed capital investment.”Comment B“We can improve the project's NPV by using the after-tax cost of debt as the discount rate. If we finance the project with 100 percent debt, this discount rate would be appropriate.”Comment C“It is generally safer to use the NPV than the IRR in making capital budgeting decisions. However, when evaluating mutually exclusive projects, if the projects have conventional cash flow patterns and have the same investment outlays, it is acceptable to use either the NPV or IRR.”Comment D“You should not base a capital budgeting decision on its immediate impact on earnings per share (EPS).”
Is Bohm most likely correct regarding Comment C that it is acceptable to use either NPV or IRR and Comment D about the immediate impact on EPS?",No for both comments.,Yes for both comments.,No for Comment C and Yes for Comment D.,,C,"Even if they are the same size, a short-term project with a high IRR can have a lower NPV than a longer-term project. The immediate impact on EPS does not capture the full effect of the cash flows over the project’s entire life."
2,"Karen Maghami is a portfolio manager for a mutual fund. Maghami, working with analyst Marcel Lynbrock, is researching two companies: Syvie Electric and EnileGEN. Located in the same country, both companies produce electricity from conventional and renewable sources. Maghami wants to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the analysis of each company’s financial statements.Syvie Electric is a stock exchange- listed, state- owned enterprise (SOE). The sovereign government holds 58% of shares; remaining shares are publicly traded. EnileGEN is a public company owned primarily by institutional investors.Lynbrock starts with an analysis of corporate governance factors. Relevant information about the two companies is summarized in Exhibit 1.

| Ownership Information and Voting Policies |  |
| Percentage of shares owned by the largest shareholder | 58% | 9% |
| Straight voting | Yes | Yes |

| Percentage of directors with experience in industry | 27% | 88% |
| Remuneration Policies |  |
| Clawback policy | No | Yes |

After reviewing the corporate governance information, Maghami and Lynbrock focus on factors related to environmental and social considerations. Lynbrock asks Maghami, “What resource would you recommend using to find a list of ESG factors material to the electricity generation sector?”Next, Maghami and Lynbrock discuss the effect of expected regulatory changes on stock and bond values for both companies. The government recently announced that it intends to authorize a new environmental regulation requiring that a minimum of 35% of electricity be produced from renewable sources. ?The exact timing of the new regulation is unknown, but EnileGEN already exceeds the minimum level by a significant margin. Maghami notes that the new regulation should give EnileGEN a competitive edge in the industry, and for scenario analysis purposes, she asks Lynbrock to assume that the regulation will take effect in two years. Lynbrock uses a discounted cash flow model to value EnileGEN stock under the assumption requested by Maghami.Lynbrock believes that the new regulation will make three of Syvie Electric’s coal-fired power stations no longer financially viable within 10 years following implementation. Maghami asks Lynbrock to estimate the potential effect on Syvie Electric’s balance sheet and the potential impact on the value of Syvie Electric bonds.Maghami reads in Syvie Electric’s most recent financial statements that the company plans to issue green bonds. Maghami asks Lynbrock to evaluate any possible valuation risks or opportunities associated with green bonds. Lynbrock tells Maghami the following:Statement 1: Green bonds offer higher protection for an investor because they typically are backed by the income derived from the environmental project they are used to fund.Statement 2: Issuing green bonds ensures a lower cost of capital because the green feature typically results in a tighter credit spread compared with conventional bonds.Statement 3: A unique risk related to green bonds is greenwashing, which is the risk that the bond’s proceeds are not actually used for a beneficial environmental or climate-related project.
Based on the ownership structures of Syvie Electric and EnileGEN, a principal–principal problem is most likely to occur in the case of:",only EnileGEN.,only Syvie Electric.,both Syvie Electric and EnileGEN.,,B,"Syvie Electric’s largest shareholder owns 58% of the shares; therefore, the company can be described as having concentrated ownership and concentrated voting power. The combination of concentrated ownership and concentrated voting power is generally associated with controlling shareholders maintaining a position of power over both managers and minority shareholders, known as a principal–principal problem. EnileGEN’s largest stockholder owns 9% of shares; hence, the company can be classified as having dispersed ownership. EnileGEN also has a straight voting policy, which results in each of the shareholders having one vote per share; thus, EnileGEN also has dispersed voting power. The combination of dispersed ownership and dispersed voting power is generally associated with shareholders who lack the power to exercise control over managers. This conflict is known as a principal–agent problem. Consequently, the principal–principal problem is most likely to occur in Syvie Electric, not in EnileGEN.<br />"
3,"María Hernández is a sell-side analyst covering the electronics industry in Spain. One of the companies she follows, SG Electronics, S.A., has recently announced plans to begin producing and selling a new series of video cameras. Hernández estimates that this project will increase the value of the company and, consequently, she plans on changing her research opinion on the company from a “hold” to a “buy.” Her initial financial predictions for the project are:● Fixed capital equipment outlay is €2,750,000.● At the beginning of the project, a required increase in current assets of €200,000 and a required increase in current liabilities of €125,000.● Straight-line depreciation to zero over a five-year life.● Project life of five years.● Incremental annual unit sales of 3,000 at a unit price of €600.● Annual fixed cash expenses of €125,000; variable cash expenses of €125 per unit.● The capital equipment is expected to be sold for €450,000 at the end of Year 5. At the end of the project, the net working capital investment will be recovered.● Tax rate of 40 percent.● Based on the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return is 12 percent.Hernández estimates the expected net present value (NPV) of the project to be €975,538 and the internal rate of return (IRR) to be 24.6 percent. She also performs a sensitivity analysis by changing the input variable assumptions used in her initial analysis.When reviewing Hernández's work, her supervisor, Arturo Costa, notes that she did not include changes in the depreciation method, initial fixed capital outlay, or inflation assumptions in her sensitivity analysis. As a result, Costa asks the following questions:Question 1“What would be the effect on the project's NPV if the initial fixed capital equipment outlay increased from €2,750,000 to €3,000,000, everything else held constant?”Question 2“How would a higher than expected inflation rate affect the value of the real tax savings from depreciation and the value of the real after-tax interest expense, everything else held constant?”Question 3“You are using a required rate of return of 12 percent when the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 10 percent. Why are you using a required rate of return for the project greater than the company's WACC?”Before ending the meeting, Costa tells Hernández: “Last year the company produced a prototype at a cost of €500,000. Now management is having doubts about the market appeal of the product in its current design, and so they are considering delaying the start of the project for a year, until the prototype can be shown to industry experts.”
Hernández's best response to Costa's first question is that the project's NPV would decrease by an amountclosest to:","€142,000.","€178,000.","€250,000.",,B,"Calculations: The outlay is higher by €250,000, which will increase annual depreciation by €50,000 over the 5-year period. The annual additional tax savings from the higher depreciation expense is: 50,000 × (0.40) = 20,000. Therefore NPV should decrease by:「huixue_img/importSubject/1564569050137366528.png」<br /><br />"

To reflect the effect of the new regulation on Syvie Electric’s balance sheet, Lynbrock should:",increase terminal value.,increase impaired assets.,decrease capital expenditures.,,B,"Syvie Electric is facing risk from stranded assets—that is, assets that are obsolete or not economically viable owing to changes in regulatory or government policy. ESG-related adjustments to a company’s balance sheet often reflect an analyst’s estimate of impaired assets. A is incorrect because adjusting terminal value applies to equity valuation; it is not an adjustment to a company’s balance sheet.<br />C is incorrect because decreasing capital expenditures would be reflected in the income and cash flow statements, not the balance sheet.<br />"
