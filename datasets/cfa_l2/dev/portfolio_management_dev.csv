0,"Michael Bloomfield is a trader at 2Fast Trading, a proprietary trading company that uses machine learning and algorithms to execute trades. He works with Amy Riley, a junior trader at the company. Bloomfield and Riley meet to review the company’s trading systems and several trades in Bloomfield’s trading account.They discuss the increasing impact of market fragmentation on available liquidity for the company’s trading strategies. Riley makes the following comments regarding market fragmentation:Comment 1: Liquidity aggregation and smart order routing help traders manage the challenges and opportunities presented by fragmentation.Comment 2: With increasing market fragmentation, traders who fill large orders now search for liquidity across multiple venues and across time to control market impact.Bloomfield tells Riley that he noticed trades of 500 shares of BYYP stock were executed every 20 minutes for an hour. Bloomfield saw the same pattern of trading in the stock during the previous trading day. He instructs Riley to submit an order to purchase BYYP shares on the assumption that a trader seeks liquidity and is executing a large buy order by breaking it into pieces. The prices of these trades and the best bids and offers in the market when the BYYP trades occurred are presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1 | BY YP Trade Details |
| Trade | Trade Price | Prevailing Bid | Prevailing Offer |
| 1 | 41.50 | 41.45 | 41.50 |
| 2 | 41.75 | 41.73 | 41.75 |


Bloomfield shifts the conversation to AXZ Corp. Bloomfield notes that AXZ’s bid–ask spread is narrow, even though AXZ’s share price has been experiencing a period of high volatility. After extensive research, Bloomfield will purchase AXZ shares using a trading strategy that does not include standing orders.Bloomfield then assesses the risks that 2Fast’s electronic trading strategies introduce into the market. He is concerned that these risks may bring on more regulation. Bloomfield claims that the risks can be reduced by changing the structure of the market, and those structural changes can maintain 2Fast’s primary competitive advantage, which is trading faster than competitors.Bloomfield mentions that a regulatory body is investigating a competitor’s trading practices. The investigation involves a tip that the competitor is manipulating markets by submitting orders and arranging trades to influence other traders’ perceptions of value. Specifically, regulators were informed that the competitor has been buying stock to raise its price, thereby encouraging momentum traders to buy, and then selling the stock to them at higher prices. The regulator confirmed that the competitor did not use standing limit orders or commonly controlled accounts for the trades under investigation.
Based on Exhibit 1, the average effective spread of the BYYP trades is closest to:",$0.018.,$0.035.,$0.070.,,B,The effective spread is calculated as follows:<br />Effective spread = 2 × (Trade price - Midpoint of market at time of order entry)<br />Effective spread of Trade 1 = 2 × ($41.50 - $41.475) = $0.05<br />Effective spread of Trade 2 = 2 × ($41.75 - $41.74) = $0.02<br />Average Effective Spread = ($0.05 + $0.02) / 2 = $0.035<br />
1,"Brian Johnson is a senior manager at Star Asset Management (SAMN), a large asset management firm in the United States. Tim Martin has just earned his advanced degree in statistics and was hired to support the trading team at SAMN. Martin meets with Johnson to undergo a training relating to SAMN's trading activities.Johnson begins the training with a review of the limit order book for Light Systems, Inc., which is presented in Exhibit 1. Three dealers make market for the shares of Light Systems. Based on these prices, SAMN's trading desk executes a market sell order for 1,100 shares of Light Systems.
| Exhibit 1Limit Order Book for Light Systems, Inc. |
| Bid | Ask |
| Dealer | TimeEntered | Price | Size | Dealer | TimeEntered | Price | Size |
| B | 10.10a.m. | $17.15 | 900 | C | 10.11a.m. | $17.19 | 1，200 |

Johnson explains to Martin that the number of venues trading the same instruments has proliferated in recent years, and trading in any given instrument has now been distributed across these multiple venues. As a result, the available liquidity on any one of those exchanges represents just a small portion of the aggregate liquidity for that security. As a result, SAMN has had to adapt its trading strategies, particularly for large trades.Johnson asks Martin about his views on how the introduction of electronic trading might have impacted SAMN. Martin tells Johnson:Statement 1 Once built, electronic trading systems are more efficient and cheaper to operate than floor-based trading systems.Statement 2 Electronic trading systems have attracted a lot of new buy-side traders, and the increased competition has resulted in narrower bid–ask spreads.Statement 3 The introduction of electronic markets has had a much greater impact on the trading of corporate and municipal bonds than on the trading of equities.Johnson tells Martin that communication speed is SAMN's current highest prior-ity. All of SAMN's competitors have increased their communication speeds in recent months, and Johnson says management wants SAMN to be faster than its competi-tors. SAMN's trading desk is located in a residential area far from downtown where the exchanges it works with are located. SAMN's trading team is relatively large with experienced investment professionals, and the firm recently invested in fast computers with the latest algorithms.At the end of the training, Johnson gives Martin his first assignment. The assign-ment is for Martin to use the vast amount of data that SAMN has collected to design a machine learning (ML) model using advanced statistical methods to characterize data structures and relations. Then he has to build a trading algorithm based on the same model. Since electronic trading has added systemic risk to the market, Johnson asks Martin to suggest ways to minimize the systemic risk introduced by his algorithm. Martin offers two suggestions:Suggestion 1 Perform extensive testing of the algorithm before its launch.Suggestion 2 Impose mandatory trading halts if prices change outside a threshold range.A month into the job, Johnson sends Martin to an investment conference focused on abusive trading practices. Based on what he learned at the conference, Martin recommends to Johnson that SAMN incorporate a new rule that news be validated before a trade triggered by news is executed.
Which market manipulation strategy is most likely the target of the new rule suggested by Martin?",Rumormongering,Gunning the market,Trading for market impact,,A,Rumormongering is the dissemination of false information about fundamental values or about other traders’ trading intentions in an attempt to alter investors' value assessments. Martin's suggested news validation rule would reduce the likelihood that SAMN would be adversely affected by this market manipulation strategy.
2,"Kata Rom is an equity analyst working for Gimingham Wealth Partners (GWP), a large investment advisory company. Rom meets with Goran Galic, a Canadian private wealth client, to explain investment strategies used by GWP to generate portfolio alpha for its clients.Rom states that GWP is recognized in the Canadian investment industry as a leading factor-based value portfolio manager and describes how GWP creates relevant investment strategies and explains GWP’s backtesting process. Rom notes the following:Statement 1: Using historical data, backtesting approximates a real-life investment process to illustrate the risk–return tradeoff of a particular proposed investment strategy.Statement 2: Backtesting is used almost exclusively by quantitative investment managers and rarely by fundamental investment managers, who are more concerned with information such as forward estimates of company earnings, macroeconomic factors, and intrinsic values.Galic, who is 62 years old, decides to allocate C$2 million (representing 10% of his net worth) to an account with GWP and stipulates that portfolio assets be restricted exclusively to domestic securities. Although GWP has not backtested its strategies with such a restriction, it has backtested its strategies using a global index that includes domestic securities. Rom shows the following risk measures to Galic for three factor portfolios.
| Exhibit 1Downside Risk Measures for Model Factors |
| Risk Measure | Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |
| Value at risk(VaR)(95%) | (6.49%) | (0.77%) | (2.40%) |
| Conditional VaR(CVaR) (95%) | (15.73%) | (4.21%) | (3.24%) |
| Maximum drawdown | 35.10% | 38.83% | 45.98% |


Galic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the following replies:Statement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a weakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in particular may not capture extreme downside risk.Statement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of financial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.In an effort to make Galic fully aware of the risks inherent in GWP’s strategies, Rom describes a recent study that investigated the return distributions of value and momentum factors that GWP uses to construct portfolios. The study found that these distributions were non-normal based on their negative skewness, excess kurtosis, and tail dependence. Rom indicated that investment strategies based on this type of data are prone to significantly higher downside risk. Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as scenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2 compares the performance of two of GWP’s factor allocation strategies in different regimes:
| Exhibit 2Scenario Analysis Using the Sharpe Ratio |
| Strategy/Regime | HighVolatility | LowVolatility | Recession | Non-recession |
| Strategy I | 0.88 | 0.64 | 0.20 | 1.00 |
| Strategy II | 1.56 | 1.60 | 1.76 | 1.52 |


Galic is surprised to see that some of the backtest results are unfavorable. He asks,“Why has GWP not considered strategies that perform better in backtesting?” Galic recently met with Fastlane Wealth Managers, who showed much better performance results. The portfolio manager at Fastlane told Galic that the company selects the top-performing strategies after performing thousands of backtests.
Which key parameter needs to be changed for a new backtest that includes Galic’s restrictions?",Start and end dates.,Consideration of transaction costs.,Investment universe.,,C,Investment universe represents the securities in which a strategy can potentially invest. Galic’s restriction to exclusively own domestic securities means the investment universe of a backtest for a strategy for Galic’s account should use a domestic rather than global investment universe.<br />A is incorrect. Galic’s restriction to domestic securities does not affect the start and end dates for a backtest.<br />B is incorrect. Galic’s restriction to domestic securities does not change the inclusion of transaction costs in the study.<br />
3,"Randy Gorver, chief risk officer at Eastern Regional Bank, and John Abell, assistant risk officer, are currently conducting a risk assessment of several of the bank's independent investment functions. These reviews include the bank's fixed-income investment portfolio and an equity fund managed by the bank's trust department. Gorver and Abell are also assessing Eastern Regional's overall risk exposure.Eastern Regional Bank Fixed-Income Investment PortfolioThe bank's proprietary fixed-income portfolio is structured as a barbell portfolio: About half of the portfolio is invested in zero-coupon Treasuries with maturities in the 3- to 5-year range (Portfolio P1), and the remainder is invested in zero-coupon Treasuries with maturities in the 10- to 15-year range (Portfolio P2. Georges Montes, the portfolio manager, has discretion to allocate between 40% and 60% of the assets to each maturity “bucket” He must remain fully invested at all times. Exhibit 1 shows details of this portfolio.
| Exhibit l.US Treasury Barbell Portfolio |
| Maturity |
| Pi | P2 |
| 3-5 Years | 10-15 Years |
| Average duration | 3.30 | 11.07 |
| Average yield to maturity | 1.45% | 2.23% |
| Market value | $50.3 million | $58.7 million |


Trust Department's Equity Funda) Use of Options: The trust department of Eastern Regional Bank manages an equity fund called the Index Plus Fund, with $325 million in assets. This fund's objective is to track the S&P 500 Index price return while producing an income return 1.5 times that of the S&P 500. The bank's chief investment officer (CIO) uses put and call options on S&P 500 stock index futures to adjust the risk exposure of certain client accounts that have an investment in this fund. The portfolio of a 60-year-old widow with a below-average risk tolerance has an investment in this fund, and the CIO has asked his assistant, Janet Ferrell, to propose an options strategy to bring the portfolio's delta to 0.90.b) Value at Risk: The Index Plus Fund has a one-day 95% value at risk (VaR) of $6.5 million. Gorver asks Abell to write a brief summary of the portfolio VaR for the report he is preparing on the fund's risk position.Combined Bank Risk ExposuresThe bank has adopted a new risk policy, which requires forward-looking risk assessments in addition to the measures that look at historical risk characteristics. Management has also become very focused on tail risk since the subprime crisis and is evaluating the bank's capital allocation to certain higher-risk lines of business. Gorver must determine what additional risk metrics to include in his risk reporting to address the new policy. He asks Abell to draft a section of the risk report that will address the risk measures' adequacy for capital allocation decisions.
To comply with the new bank policy on risk assessment, which of the following is the best set of risk measures to add to the chief risk officer's risk reporting?","Conditional VaR, stress test, and scenario analysis","Monte Carlo VaR, incremental VaR, and stress test","Parametric VaR, marginal VaR, and scenario analysis",,A,"The bank policy requires the addition of forward-looking risk assessments, and management is focused on tail risk. Conditional VaR measures tail risk, and stress tests and scenario analysis subject current portfolio holdings to historical or hypothetical stress events.<br />"
4,"Carlos Altuve is a manager-of-managers at an investment company that uses quantitative models extensively. Altuve seeks to construct a multi-manager portfolio using some of the funds managed by portfolio managers within the firm. Maya Zapata is assisting him.Altuve uses arbitrage pricing theory (APT) as a basis for evaluating strategies and managing risks. From his earlier analysis, Zapata knows that Funds A and B in Exhibit 1 are well diversified. He has not previously worked with Fund C and is puzzled by the data because it is inconsistent with APT. He asks Zapata gather additional information on Fund C's holdings and to determine if an arbitrage opportunity exists among these three investment alternatives. Her analysis, using the data in Exhibit 1, confirms that an arbitrage opportunity does exist.
| Exhibit l.Expected Returns and Factor Sensitivities(One-Factor Mode) |
| Fund | Expected Return | Factor Sensitivity |
| A | 0.02 | 0.5 |
| B | 0.04 | 1.5 |
| C | 0.03 | 0.9 |


The manager of Fund C makes some modifications to his portfolio and eliminates the arbitrage opportunity. Using a two-factor model, Zapata now estimates the three funds'sensitivity to inflation and GDP growth. That information is presented in Exhibit 2. Zapata assumes a zero value for the error terms when working with the selected two-factor model.
| Exhibit 2.Expected Returns and Factor Sensitivities(Two-Factor Mode) |
| Fund | Factor Sensitivity | Expected Return |
| Inflation | GDP Growth |
| A | 0.02 | 0.5 | 1.0 |
| B | 0.04 | 1.6 | 0.0 |
| C | 0.03 | 1.0 | 1.1 |


Altuve asks Zapata to calculate the return for Portfolio AC, composed of a 60% allocation to Fund A and 40% allocation to Fund C, using the surprises in inflation and GDP growth in Exhibit 3.
| Exhibit 3.Selected Data on Factors |
| Factor | Research Staff Forecast | Actual Value |
| Inflation | 2.0% | 2.2% |
| GDP Growth | 1.5% | 1.0% |


Finally, Altuve asks Zapata about the return sensitivities of Portfolios A, B, and C given the information provided in Exhibit 3.
The two-factor model Zapata uses is a:",statistical factor model.,fundamental factor model.,macroeconomic factor model.,,C,"In a macroeconomic factor model, the factors are surprises in macroeconomic variables, such as inflation risk and GDP growth, that significantly explain returns.<br />"
