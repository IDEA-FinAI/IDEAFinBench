0,"Tiu Asset Management (TAM), a hypothetical financial services firm, recently hired Jonna Yun. Yun is a member of TAM’s Global Equity portfolio team and is assigned the task of analyzing the effects of regulation on the financial services sector of a par-ticular country. In her first report to the team, Yun makes the following statements:Statement 1 The country’s regulator, a government agency, concerned about systemic risk, is calling for an accelerated adoption of central-ized derivatives settlement (as opposed to bilateral settlement between two counterparties)—a more stringent rule—ahead of other major countries that are considering a similar move.Statement 2 Regulators use various tools to intervene in the financial services sector.Statement 3 Regulations may bring benefits to the economy, but they may also have unanticipated costs.Statement 4 The country’s regulatory authorities are considering a regula-tion that is similar to Regulation Q in the United States, which imposed a ceiling on interest rates paid by banks for certain bank deposits.
What is the most likely basis for the concerns noted in Statement 1?",Externalities,Regulatory arbitrage,Informational friction,,B,"Firms based in the country are likely to be concerned because of the earlier timing of the application of new (more stringent) regulations in the country than in other large countries. With more stringent regulations, some business may flow to less stringent regulatory environments or jurisdictions.<br />"
1,"Cate Stephenson is an analyst in the economics research division of an international securities firm. She is conducting research on the regulatory environment in certain European countries. Stephenson begins with an analysis of Genovia.Genovia has recently introduced a new accounting statute. In Genovia, there is an independent regulator - “Le regulateur.” Le regulateur is not a self-regulating organization (SRO). There is also an SRO – “L'organisation.” L'organisation is not an independent regulator.In her research report, Stephenson makes the following statements:Statement 1:Le regulateur has been given legal authority by the government to enforce the new statute.Statement 2:L'organisation issues administrative regulations related to the new statute using government funding.Statement 3:L'organisation has member companies that accept the authorization of L'organisation to set and enforce rules and standards. Stephenson and her supervisor discuss the intended and unintended effects of implementing the new statute, and Stephenson makes two comments.Comment 1:It is likely that some unintended consequences will be identified in regulatory filings prior to implementation of the new legislation.Comment 2:Indirect costs arise because of unintended consequences and may result in high unanticipated costs.Stephenson reads a report titled ""International Trade;' which has three sections about Genovia's policies and regulations.The first section of the report discusses policies that legislators may implement to accomplish Genovia's objective of promoting free trade on industrial goods.The second section of the report covers corporate domicile. Stephenson learns that regulators in Genovia recently amended regulations to encourage foreign businesses to move their corporate domicile to Genovia.The third section of the report reviews the regulation of commerce. Genovia's goal is to establish an environment that encourages foreign businesses to increase trade with domestic businesses. Stephenson considers two features of Genovia's regulation of commerce.Feature 1:Recent court decisions have upheld financial liability and bankruptcy laws.Feature 2:A legal structure is in place governing contracts and each party's rights.Stephenson then reviews two initiatives by Genovia to improve domestic policies and regulations.The first initiative by Genovia is its passage of conflict of interest regulations. Regulators implement regulatory restrictions and regulatory mandates that apply to employees of securities firms. One of Stephenson's research colleagues writes reports on a company in which he owns shares.The second initiative by Genovia is to reduce pollution and promote renewable electricity generation. Two years ago, the government implemented taxes on fossil fuels and subsidies on hydropower and other renewables. Stephenson reviews the changes in sources of electricity production since the policies were introduced, shown in Exhibit 1.

By amending regulations to encourage foreign businesses to change their corporate domicile, regulators are encouraging regulatory:",capture.,arbitrage.,competition.,,C,"Regulatory competition describes actions by regulators to encourage behaviors. Regulators may compete to provide a regulatory environment designed to attract certain entities (regulatory competition). By amending regulations, Genovia's regulators seek to encourage foreign companies to change their corporate domicile.<br />"
2,"Victor Klymchuk, the chief economist at ECONO Consulting (EC), is reviewing the long-term GDP growth of three countries over the recent decade. Klymchuk is interested in forecasting the long-term change in stock market value for each country. Exhibit 1 presents current country characteristics and historical information on selected economic variables for the three countries.

Klymchuk instructs an associate economist at EC to assist him in forecasting the change in stock market value for each country. Klymchuk reminds the associate:Statement 1:“Over short time horizons, percentage changes in GDP, the ratio of earnings to GDP, and the price-to-earnings ratio are important factors for describing the relationship between economic growth and stock prices. However, I am interested in a long-term stock market forecast.”A client is considering investing in the sovereign debt of Country A and Country B and asks Klymchuk his opinion of each country's credit risk. Klymchuk tells the client:Statement 2:“Over the next 10 years, I forecast higher potential GDP growth for Country A and lower potential GDP growth for Country B. The capital per worker is similar and very high for both countries, but per capita output is greater for Country A.”The client tells Klymchuk that Country A will offer 50-year bonds and that he believes the bonds could be a good long-term investment given the higher potential GDP growth. Klymchuk responds to the client by saying:Statement 3:After the next 10 years, I think the sustainable rate of economic growth for Country A will be affected by a growing share of its population over the age of 65, a declining percentage under age 16, and minimal immigration.”The client is surprised to learn that Country C, a wealthy, oil-rich country with significant reserves, is experiencing sluggish economic growth and asks Klymchuk for an explanation. Klymchuk responds by stating:Statement 4:“While countries with access to natural resources are often wealthier, the relationship between resource abundance and economic growth is not clear. My analysis shows that the presence of a dominant natural resource (oil) in Country C is constraining growth. Interestingly, Country A has few natural resources, but is experiencing a strong rate of increase in per capita GDP growth.”Klymchuk knows that growth in per capita income cannot be sustained by pure capital deepening. He asks the associate economist to determine how important capital deepening is as a source of economic growth for each country. Klymchuk instructs the associate to use the data provided in Exhibit 1.Klymchuk and his associate debate the concept of convergence. The associate economist believes that developing countries, irrespective of their particular characteristics, will eventually equal developed countries in per capita output. Klymchuk responds as follows:Statement 5:“Poor countries will only converge to the income levels of the richest countries if they make appropriate institutional changes.”
Based upon Exhibit 1, capital deepening as a source of growth was most important for:",Country A.,Country B.,Country C.,,A,"The associate economist can measure the effect of pure capital deepening by measuring the difference of the growth rates of labor productivity and total factor productivity (TFP). The larger the difference, the more important capital deepening is as a source of economic growth. From 2000–2010, Country A's labor productivity grew by 2.4% per year, of which 0.6% came from TFP growth and 1.8% from capital deepening (2.4% – 0.6% = 1.8%).<br />"
3,"Hans Schmidt, CFA, is a portfolio manager with a boutique investment firm that specializes in sovereign credit analysis. Schmidt's supervisor asks him to develop estimates for GDP growth for three countries. Information on the three countries is provided in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Select Economic Data for Countries A， B， and C |
| Country | Economy | Capital per Worker |
| A | Developed | High |
| B | Developed | High |
| C | Developing | Low |


After gathering additional data on the three countries, Schmidt shares his findings with colleague, Sean O'Leary. After reviewing the data, O'Leary notes the following observations:Observation 1:The stock market of Country A has appreciated considerably over the past several years. Also, the ratio of corporate profits to GDP for Country A has been trending upward over the past several years and is now well above its historical average.Observation 2:The government of Country C is working hard to bridge the gap between its standard of living and that of developed countries. Currently, the rate of potential GDP growth in Country C is high.Schmidt knows that a large part of the analysis of sovereign credit is to develop a thorough understanding of what the potential GDP growth rate is for a particular country and the region in which the country is located. Schmidt is also doing research on Country D for a client of the firm. Selected economic facts on Country D are provided in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Select Economic Facts for Country D |
| > | Slow GDP Growth |
| > | Abundant Natural Resources |
| > | Developed Economic Institutions |


Prior to wrapping up his research, Schmidt schedules a final meeting with O'Leary to see if he can provide any other pertinent information. O'Leary makes the following statements to Schmidt:Statement 1:Many countries that have the same population growth rate, savings rate, and production function will have growth rates that converge over time.Statement 2:Convergence between countries can occur more quickly if economies are open and there is free trade and international borrowing and lending; however, there is no permanent increase in the rate of growth in an economy from a more open trade policy.
Based upon Observation 1, in the long run the ratio of profits to GDP in Country A is most likely to:",remain near its current level.,increase from its current level.,decrease from its current level.,,C,"The ratio of profits to GDP for Country A has been trending upward over the past several years, and is now well above its historical average. The ratio of profits to GDP cannot rise forever. At some point stagnant labor income would make workers unwilling to work without an increase in wages and would also undermine demand, making further expansion of profit margins unsustainable. Thus, it is likely that the ratio of profits to GDP will decline in the long run toward its historical average.<br />"

Which of Stephenson's comment to her supervisor is most likely correct?",Only Comment 1 is correct.,Only Comment 2 is correct.,Both Comment 1 and Comment 2 are correct.,,C,"Comment 1 is correct because regulatory filings, in response to proposed regulations, often identify at least some of the unintended consequences prior to the implementation of the regulation. Comment 2 is correct because the cost of unintended consequences, including both indirect costs and unanticipated implementation costs, can be high.<br />"
