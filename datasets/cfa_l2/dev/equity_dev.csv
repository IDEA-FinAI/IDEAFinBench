0,"Assorted Fund, a UK-based globally diversified equity mutual fund, is considering adding Talisman Energy Inc. (Toronto Stock Exchange: TLM) to its portfolio. Talisman is an independent upstream oil and gas company headquartered in Calgary, Canada. It is one of the largest oil and gas companies in Canada and has operations in several countries. Brian Dobson, an analyst at the mutual fund, has been assigned the task of estimating a fair value of Talisman. Dobson is aware of several approaches that could be used for this purpose. After carefully considering the characteristics of the company and its competitors, he believes the company will have extraordinary growth for the next few years and normal growth thereafter. So, he has concluded that a two-stage DDM is the most appropriate for valuing the stock.Talisman pays semi-annual dividends. The total dividends during 2006, 2007, and 2008 have been C$0.114, C$0.15, and C$0.175, respectively. These imply a growth rate of 32 percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2008. Dobson believes that the growth rate will be 14 percent in the next year. He has estimated that the first stage will include the next eight years.Dobson is using the CAPM to estimate the required return on equity for Talisman. He has estimated that the beta of Talisman, as measured against the S&P/TSX Composite Index (formerly TSE 300 Composite Index), is 0.84. The Canadian risk-free rate, as measured by the annual yield on the 10-year government bond, is 4.1 percent. The equity risk premium for the Canadian market is estimated at 5.5 percent. Based on these data, Dobson has estimated that the required return on Talisman stock is 0.041 + 0.84(0.055) = 0.0872 or 8.72 percent. Dobson is doing the analysis in January 2009 and the stock price at that time is C$17.Dobson realizes that even within the two-stage DDM, there could be some variations in the approach. He would like to explore how these variations affect the valuation of the stock. Specifically, he wants to estimate the value of the stock for each of the following approaches separately.I. The dividend growth rate will be 14 percent throughout the first stage of eight years. The dividend growth rate thereafter will be 7 percent.II. Instead of using the estimated stable growth rate of 7 percent in the second stage, Dobson wants to use his estimate that eight years later Talisman’s stock will be worth 17 times its earnings per share (trailing P/E of 17). He expects that the earnings retention ratio at that time will be 0.70.III. In contrast to the first approach above in which the growth rate declines abruptly from 14 percent in the eighth year to 7 percent in the ninth, the growth rate would decline linearly from 14 percent in the first year to 7 percent in the ninth.
In the first approach, what proportion of the total value of the stock is represented by the value of second stage?",0.10.,0.52.,0.90.,,C,"As shown in the above table, the value of the second stage = PV of V<sub>8</sub>= C$15.9095. The total value is C$17.6528. As a proportion, the second stage represents 15.9095/17.6528 = 0.90 of the total value.<br />"

Leigh presents his valuations of the common stock of Emerald and Holt to his supervisor, Alice Smith. Smith has the following questions and comments:1 “I estimate that Emerald’s long-term expected dividend payout rate is 20% and its return on equity is 10% over the long term.”2 “Why did you use an FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock? Can you use a DDM instead?”3 “How did Holt’s FCFE for 2020 compare with its FCFF for the same year? I recommend you use an FCFF model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using an FCFE model because Holt has had a history of leverage changes in the past.”4 “In the last three years, about 5% of Holt’s growth in FCFE has come from decreases in inventory.”Leigh responds to each of Smith’s points as follows:1 “I will use your estimates and calculate Emerald’s long-term, sustainable dividend growth rate.”2 “There are two reasons why I used the FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using a DDM. The first reason is that Holt’s dividends have differed significantly from its capacity to pay dividends. The second reason is that Holt is a takeover target and once the company is taken over, the new owners will have discretion over the uses of free cash flow.”3 “I will calculate Holt’s FCFF for 2020 and estimate the value of Holt’s common stock using an FCFF model.”4 “Holt is a growing company. In forecasting either Holt’s FCFE or FCFF growth rates, I will not consider decreases in inventory to be a long-term source of growth.”
Which of the following long-term FCFE growth rates is most consistent with the facts and stated policies of Emerald?",5% or lower.,2% or higher.,8% or higher.,,C,"The sustainable growth rate is return on equity (ROE) multiplied by the retention ratio. ROE is 10%, and the retention ratio is 1 – Payout ratio, or 1.0 – 0.2 = 0.8. The sustainable growth rate is 0.8 × 10% = 8%. FCFE growth should be at least 8% per year in the long term.<br />"
2,"Guardian Capital is a rapidly growing US investment firm. The Guardian Capital research team is responsible for identifying undervalued and overvalued publicly traded equities that have a market capitalization greater than $500 million.Due to the rapid growth of assets under management, Guardian Capital recently hired a new analyst, Jack Richardson, to support the research process. At the new analyst orientation meeting, the director of research made the following statements about equity valuation at Guardian:Statement 1“Analysts at Guardian Capital seek to identify mispricing, relying on price eventually converging to intrinsic value. However, convergence of the market price to an analyst’s estimate of intrinsic value may not happen within the portfolio manager’s investment time horizon. So, besides evidence of mispricing, analysts should look for the presence of a particular market or corporate event,—that is, a catalyst— that will cause the marketplace to re-evaluate the subject firm’s prospects.”Statement 2“An active investment manager attempts to capture positive alpha. But mispricing of assets is not directly observable. It is therefore important that you understand the possible sources of perceived mispricing.”Statement 3“For its distressed securities fund, Guardian Capital screens its investable universe of securities for companies in financial distress.”Statement 4“For its core equity fund, Guardian Capital selects financially sound companies that are expected to generate significant positive free cash flow from core business operations within a multiyear forecast horizon.”Statement 5“Guardian Capital’s research process requires analysts to evaluate the reasonableness of the expectations implied by the market price by comparing the market’s implied expectations to his or her own expectations.”After the orientation meeting, the director of research asks Richardson to evaluate three companies that are retailers of men’s clothing: Diamond Co., Renaissance Clothing, and Deluxe Men’s Wear.Richardson starts his analysis by evaluating the characteristics of the men’s retail clothing industry. He finds few barriers to new retail entrants, high intra-industry rivalry among retailers, low product substitution costs for customers and a large number of wholesale clothing suppliers.While conducting his analysis, Richardson discovers that Renaissance Clothing included three non-recurring items in their most recent earnings release: a positive litigation settlement, a one-time tax credit, and the gain on the sale of a non-operating asset.To estimate each firm’s intrinsic value, Richardson applies appropriate discount rates to each firm’s estimated free cash flows over a ten-year time horizon and to the estimated value of the firm at the end of the ten-year horizon.Michelle Lee, a junior technology analyst at Guardian, asks the director of research for advice as to which valuation model to use for VEGA, a fast growing semiconductor company that is rapidly gaining market share.The director of research states that “the valuation model selected must be consistent with the characteristics of the company being valued.”Lee tells the director of research that VEGA is not expected to be profitable for several more years. According to management guidance, when the company turns profitable, it will invest in new product development; as a result, it does not expect to initiate a dividend for an extended period of time. Lee also notes that she expects that certain larger competitors will become interested in acquiring VEGA because of its excellent growth prospects. The director of research advises Lee to consider that in her valuation.
Which of the following statements about the reported earnings of Renaissance Clothing is most accurate? Relative to sustainable earnings, reported earnings are likely:",unbiased.,upward biased.,downward biased.,,B,"The effects of favorable nonrecurring events in reported earnings would tend to bias reported earnings upward relative to sustainable earnings because non-recurring items are by definition not expected to repeat. Renaissance Clothing included three non-recurring items in their most recent earnings release that all led to higher earnings for the current period: a positive litigation settlement, a one-time tax credit, and the gain on the sale of a non-operating asset.<br />"
3,"Alan Chin, the chief executive officer of Thunder Corporation, has asked his chief financial officer, Constance Ebinosa, to prepare a valuation of Thunder for the purpose of selling the company to a private investment partnership. Thunder is a profitable $200 million annual sales US domiciled manufacturer of generic household products. Customers consist of several grocery store chains in the United States. Competitors include large companies such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox, and Unilever. Thunder has been in business for 15 years and is privately owned by the original shareholders, none of whom are employed by the company. The company’s senior management has been in charge of the company’s operations for most of the past 15 years and expects to remain in that capacity after any sale.The partnership has expectations about Thunder similar to the current shareholders and management of Thunder. These investors expect to hold Thunder for an intermediate period of time and then bring the company public when market conditions are more favorable than currently.Chin is concerned about what definition of value should be used when analyzing Thunder. He notes that the stock market has been very volatile recently. He also wonders whether fair market value can be realistically estimated when the most similar recent private market transactions may not have been at arm’s length.Chin asks Ebinosa whether there will be differences in the process of valuing a private company like Thunder compared with a public company. Ebinosa replies that differences do exist and mentions several factors an analyst must consider.Ebinosa also explains that several approaches are available for valuing private companies. She mentions that one possibility is to use an asset-based approach because Thunder has a relatively large and efficient factory and warehouse for its products. A real estate appraiser can readily determine the value of these facilities. A second method would be the market approach and using an average of the price-to-earnings multiples for Procter & Gamble and Clorox. A third possibility is a discounted free cash flow approach. The latter would focus on a continuation of Thunder’s trend of slow profitable growth during the past ten years.The private investment partnership has mentioned that they are likely to use an income approach as one of their methods. Ebinosa decides to validate the estimates they make. She assumes for the next 12 months that Thunder’s revenues increase by the long-term annual growth rate of 3 percent. She also makes the following assumptions to calculate the free cash flow to the firm for the next 12 months:● Gross profit margin is 45 percent. ? Depreciation is 2 percent of revenues.● Selling, general, and administrative expenses are 24 percent of revenues.● Capital expenditures equal 125 percent of depreciation to support the current level of revenues.● Additional capital expenditures of 15 percent of incremental revenues are needed to fund future growth.● Working capital investment equals 8 percent of incremental revenues.● Marginal tax rate on EBIT is 35 percent.Chin knows that if an income approach is used then the choice of discount rate may have a large influence on the estimated value. He makes two statements regarding discount rate estimates:1. If the CAPM method is used to estimate the discount rate with a beta estimate based on public companies with operations and revenues similar to Thunder, then a small stock premium should be added to the estimate.2. The weighted average cost of capital of the private investment partnership should be used to value Thunder.Ebinosa decides to calculate a value of Thunder’s equity using the capitalized cash flow method (CCM) and decides to use the build-up method to estimate Thunder’s required return on equity. She makes the following assumptions:● Growth of FCFE is at a constant annual rate of 3 percent.● Free cash flow to equity for the year ahead is $2.5 million.● Risk free rate is 4.5 percent.● Equity risk premium is 5.0 percent.● Size premium is 2.0 percent.
Regarding the two statements about discount rate estimates, Chin is:",correct with respect to adding the small stock premium and correct with respect to the weighted average cost of capital.,correct with respect to adding the small stock premium and incorrect with respect to the weighted average cost of capital.,incorrect with respect to adding the small stock premium and incorrect with respect to the weighted average cost of capital.,,C,"Both statements by Chin are incorrect. If the CAPM is used with public companies with similar operations and similar revenue size, as stated, then the calculation likely captures the small stock premium and should not be added to the estimate. Small stock premiums are associated with build-up models and the expanded CAPM, rather than the CAPM per se. The correct weighted average cost of capital should reflect the risk of Thunder’s cash flows not the risk of the acquirer’s cash flows.<br />"

Which valuation model is Richardson applying in his analysis of the retailers?",Relative value,Absolute value,Sum-of-the-parts,,B,An absolute valuation model is a model that specifies an asset’s intrinsic value. The most important type of absolute equity valuation models are present value models (also referred to as discounted cash flow models) and the model described by Richardson is of that type.<br />
