Pinho asks Silveira about the possible use of the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) in assessing the relative value of the three companies. Silveira tells Pinho:● Statement 1The P/S is not affected by revenue recognition practices.● Statement 2The P/S is less subject to distortion from expense accounting than is the P/E. Pinho asks Silveira about using the Fed and Yardeni models to assess the value of the equity market. Silveira states:● Statement 3The Fed model concludes that the market is undervalued when the market’s current earnings yield is greater than the 10-year Treasury bond yield.● Statement 4The Yardeni model includes the consensus five-year earnings growth rate forecast for the market index. Silveira also analyzes the three companies using the enterprising value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple.Silveira notes that the EBITDA for Gesticular for the most recent year is R$560 million and gathers other selected information on Gesticular, which is presented in Exhibit 4.

Pinho asks Silveira about the use of momentum indicators in assessing the shares of the three companies. Silveira states:● Statement 5Relative-strength indicators compare an equity’s performance during a period with the performance of some group of equities or its own past performance.● Statement 6In the calculation of standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), the magnitude of unexpected earnings is typically scaled by the standard deviation of analysts’ earnings forecasts.
Based on Exhibit 4, Gesticular’s EV/EBITDA multiple is closest to:",11.4.,13.7.,14.6.,
