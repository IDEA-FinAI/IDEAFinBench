0,"Raffi Musicale is the portfolio manager for a defined benefit pension plan. He meets with Jenny Brown, market strategist with Menlo Bank, to discuss possible investment opportunities. The investment committee for the pension plan has recently approved expanding the plan's permitted asset mix to include alternative asset classes.Brown proposes the Apex Commodity Fund (Apex Fund) offered by Menlo Bank as a potentially suitable investment for the pension plan. The Apex Fund attempts to produce trading profits by capitalizing on the mispricing between the spot and futures prices of commodities. The fund has access to storage facilities, allowing it to take delivery of commodities when necessary. The Apex Fund's current asset allocation is presented in Exhibit 1.

Brown explains that the Apex Fund has had historically low correlations with stocks and bonds, resulting in diversification benefits. Musicale asks Brown, “Can you identify a factor that affects the valuation of financial assets like stocks and bonds but does not affect the valuation of commodities?”Brown shares selected futures contract data for three markets in which the Apex Fund invests.

Menlo Bank recently released a report on the coffee market. Brown shares the key conclusion from the report with Musicale: “The coffee market had a global harvest that was greater than expected. Despite the large harvest, coffee futures trading activity is balanced between producers and consumers. This balanced condition is not expected to change over the next year”Brown shows Musicale the total return of a recent trade executed by the Apex Fund. Brown explains that the Apex Fund took a fully collateralized long futures position in nearby soybean futures contracts at the quoted futures price of 865.0 (US cents/bushel). Three months later, the entire futures position was rolled when the near-term futures price was 877.0 and the farther-term futures price was 883.0. During the three-month period between the time that the initial long position was taken and the rolling of the contract, the collateral earned an annualized rate of 0.60%.Brown tells Musicale that the pension fund could alternatively gain long exposure to commodities using the swap market. Brown and Musicale analyze the performance of a long position in an S&P GSCI total return swap having monthly resets and a notional amount of $25 million.

As part of the review, Tang asks Rodriguez to evaluate financing alternatives to determine if it would be better to use debt financing or to make an all cash purchase. Tang directs Rodriguez to inquire about terms with Richmond Life Insurance Company, a publicly traded company, which is an active lender on commercial real estate property. Rodriquez obtains the following information from Richmond Life for a loan on Property #1: loan term of 5 years, interest rate of 5.75% interest-only, maximum loan to value of 75%, and minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.5x.After reviewing her research materials, Rodriguez formulates the following two conclusions:Conclusion 1Benefits of private equity real estate investments include owners’ ability to attain diversification benefits, to earn current income, and to achieve tax benefits.Conclusion 2Risk factors of private equity real estate investments include business conditions, demographics, the cost of debt and equity capital, and financial leverage.

3,"Hui Lin, CFA is an investment manager looking to diversify his portfolio by adding equity real estate investments. Lin and his investment analyst, Maria Nowak, are discussing whether they should invest in publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) or public real estate operating companies (REOCs). Nowak expresses a strong preference for investing in public REITs in taxable accounts.Lin schedules a meeting to discuss this matter, and for the meeting, Lin asks Nowak to gather data on three specific REITs and come prepared to explain her preference for public REITs over public REOCs. At the meeting, Lin asks Nowak:“Why do you prefer to invest in public REITs over public REOCs for taxable accounts?” Nowak provides Lin with an explanation for her preference of public REITs and provides Lin with data on the three REITs shown in Exhibits 1 and 2.The meeting concludes with Lin directing Nowak to identify the key investment characteristics along with the principal risks of each REIT and to investigate the valuation of the three REITs. Specifically, Lin asks Nowak to value each REIT using four different methodologies:Method 1Net asset valueMethod 2Discounted cash flow valuation using a two-step dividend modelMethod 3Relative valuation using property subsector average P/FFO multipleMethod 4Relative valuation using property subsector average P/AFFO multiple

4,"Daniel Collin is a junior analyst at JRR Equity Partners, a private equity firm. Collin is assigned to work with Susan Tseng, a senior portfolio manager. Tseng and Collin meet to discuss existing and potential investments.Tseng starts the meeting with a discussion of LBO firms and VC firms. Collin tells Tseng,LBO firms tend to invest in companies with predicable cash flows and experienced management teams, whereas VC firms tend to invest in companies with high EBITDA or EBIT growth and where an exit is fairly predictable.Tseng and Collin next analyze a potential investment in the leveraged buyout of Stoneham Industries. Specifically, they assess the expected gain if they elect to purchase all the preference shares and 90% of the common equity in the LBO. Details of the LBO include the following:●The buyout requires an initial investment of $10 million.●Financing for the deal includes $6 million in debt, $3.6 million in preference shares that promise a 15% annual return paid at exit, and $0.4 million in common equity.The expected exit value in six years is $15 million, with an estimated reduction in debt of $2.8 million over the six years prior to exit.Tseng and Collin next discuss JRR's investment in Venture Holdings, a private equity fund. Selected details on the Venture Holdings fund include the following:●Total committed capital is $115 million.●The distribution waterfall follows the deal-by-deal method, and carried interest is 20%.●On its first exit event a few years ago, the fund generated a $10 million profit.●At the end of the most recent year, cumulative paid-in capital was $98 million, cumulative distributions paid out to LPs were $28 million, and the year-end NAV, before and after distributions, was $170.52 million and $131.42 million, respectively.●Tseng and Collin estimate that the fund's NAV before distributions will be $242.32 million at the end of next year.Finally, Tseng and Collin evaluate two venture capital funds for potential investment: the Squire Fund and the Treble Fund. Both funds are in Year 7 of an estimated 10-year term. Selected data for the two funds are presented in Exhibit 1.

After reviewing the performance data in Exhibit 1, Collin draws the following conclusions:Conclusion 1 The unrealized return on investment for the Squire Fund is greater than the unrealized return on investment for the Treble Fund.Conclusion 2 The TVPI for the Treble Fund is higher than the TVPI for the Squire Fund because the Treble Fund has a higher gross IRR.

5,"Jamal Nabli is a portfolio manager at NextWave Commodities (NWC), a commodity-based hedge fund located in the United States. NWC's strategy uses a fixed-weighting scheme to allocate exposure among 12 commodities, and it is benchmarked against the Thomson/Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index (TR/CC CRB). Nabli manages the energy and livestock sectors with the help of Sota Yamata, a junior analyst.Nabli and Yamata meet to discuss a variety of factors that affect commodity values in the two sectors they manage. Yamata tells Nabli the following:Statement 1 Storage costs are negatively related to futures prices.Statement 2 In contrast to stocks and bonds, most commodity investments are made by using derivatives.Statement 3 Commodities generate future cash flows beyond what can be realized through their purchase and sale.Nabli and Yamata then discuss potential new investments in the energy sector. They review Brent crude oil futures data, which are presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1 | Selected Data on Brent Crude Oil Futures |
| Near-Term Futures | Longer-Term Futures |
| Spot Price | Price | Price |
| 77.56 | 73.64 | 73.59 |


Yamata presents his research related to the energy sector, which has the following conclusions:■ Consumers have been more concerned about prices than producers have.■ Energy is consumed on a real-time basis and requires minimal storage.After concluding the discussion of the energy sector, Nabli reviews the performance of NWC's long position in lean hog futures contracts. Nabli notes that the portfolio earned a –12% price return on the lean hog futures position last year and a –24% roll return after the contracts were rolled forward. The position was held with collateral equal to 100% of the position at a risk-free rate of 1.2% per year.Yamata asks Nabli to clarify how the state of the futures market affects roll returns. Nabli responds as follows:Statement 4 Roll returns are generally negative when a futures market is in contango.Statement 5 Roll returns are generally positive when a futures market is in backwardation.As part of their expansion into new markets, NWC is considering changing its benchmark index. Nabli investigates two indexes as a possible replacement. These indexes both use similar weighting and rebalancing schemes. Index A includes con-tracts of commodities typically in contango, whereas Index B includes contracts of commodities typically in backwardation. Nabli asks Yamata how the two indexes perform relative to each other in a market that is trending upward.Because of a substantial decline in drilling activity in the North Sea, Nabli believes the price of Brent crude oil will increase more than that of heavy crude oil. The actual price volatility of Brent crude oil has been lower than its expected volatility, and Nabli expects this trend to continue. Nabli also expects the level of the ICE Brent Index to increase from its current level. Nabli and Yamata discuss how to use swaps to take advantage of Nabli's expectations. The possible positions are (1) a basis swap long on Brent crude oil and short on heavy crude oil, (2) a long volatility swap on Brent crude oil, and (3) a short position in an excess return swap that is based on a fixed level (i.e., the current level) of the ICE Brent Index.
Given Nabli's expectations for crude oil, the most appropriate swap position is the:",basis swap.,volatility swap.,excess return swap.,,A

He is meeting with Mark Caudill, a new client who is looking to diversify his investment portfolio by adding real estate investments. Caudill has heard about various investment vehicles related to real estate from his friends and is seeking a more in-depth understanding of these investments from Wang.Wang begins the meeting by advising Caudill of the many options that are available when investing in real estate, including the following:Option 1 Direct ownership in real estateOption 2 Publicly traded real estate investment trustsOption 3 Publicly traded real estate operating companiesOption 4 Publicly-traded residential mortgage-backed securitiesWang next asks Caudill about his investment preferences. Caudill responds by telling Wang that he prefers to invest in equity securities that are highly liquid, provide high income, and are not subject to double taxation.Caudill asks Wang how the economic performance of REITs and REOCs is evaluated and how their shares are valued. Wang advises Caudill there are multiple measures of economic performance for REITs and REOCs, including the following:Measure 1 Net operating incomeMeasure 2 Funds from operationsMeasure 3 Adjusted funds from operationsIn response, Caudill asks Wang:“Which of the three measures is the best measure of a REIT’s current economic return to shareholders?”To help Caudill’s understanding of valuation, Wang presents Caudill with data on Baldwin, a health care REIT that primarily invests in independent and assisted senior housing communities in large cities across the United States. Selected financial data on Baldwin for the past two years are provided in Exhibit 1.

9,"Daniel Collin is a junior analyst at JRR Equity Partners, a private equity firm. Collin is assigned to work with Susan Tseng, a senior portfolio manager. Tseng and Collin meet to discuss existing and potential investments.Tseng starts the meeting with a discussion of LBO firms and VC firms. Collin tells Tseng,LBO firms tend to invest in companies with predicable cash flows and experienced management teams, whereas VC firms tend to invest in companies with high EBITDA or EBIT growth and where an exit is fairly predictable.Tseng and Collin next analyze a potential investment in the leveraged buyout of Stoneham Industries. Specifically, they assess the expected gain if they elect to purchase all the preference shares and 90% of the common equity in the LBO. Details of the LBO include the following:●The buyout requires an initial investment of $10 million.●Financing for the deal includes $6 million in debt, $3.6 million in preference shares that promise a 15% annual return paid at exit, and $0.4 million in common equity.The expected exit value in six years is $15 million, with an estimated reduction in debt of $2.8 million over the six years prior to exit.Tseng and Collin next discuss JRR's investment in Venture Holdings, a private equity fund. Selected details on the Venture Holdings fund include the following:●Total committed capital is $115 million.●The distribution waterfall follows the deal-by-deal method, and carried interest is 20%.●On its first exit event a few years ago, the fund generated a $10 million profit.●At the end of the most recent year, cumulative paid-in capital was $98 million, cumulative distributions paid out to LPs were $28 million, and the year-end NAV, before and after distributions, was $170.52 million and $131.42 million, respectively.●Tseng and Collin estimate that the fund's NAV before distributions will be $242.32 million at the end of next year.Finally, Tseng and Collin evaluate two venture capital funds for potential investment: the Squire Fund and the Treble Fund. Both funds are in Year 7 of an estimated 10-year term. Selected data for the two funds are presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Selected Data for the Squire Fund and the Treble Fund |
| Squire Fund | Treble Fund |
| DPI | 0.11 | 0.55 |
| RVP I | 0.95 | 0.51 |
| Gross IRR | -11% | 10% |
| Net IRR | -20% | 8% |


After reviewing the performance data in Exhibit 1, Collin draws the following conclusions:Conclusion 1 The unrealized return on investment for the Squire Fund is greater than the unrealized return on investment for the Treble Fund.Conclusion 2 The TVPI for the Treble Fund is higher than the TVPI for the Squire Fund because the Treble Fund has a higher gross IRR.
Is Collin's statement about LBO firms and VC firms correct?",Yes,"No, because he is wrong with respect to VC firms.","No, because he is wrong with respect to LBO firms.",,B
10,"Tim Wang is a financial adviser specializing in commercial real estate investing. He is meeting with Mark Caudill, a new client who is looking to diversify his investment portfolio by adding real estate investments. Caudill has heard about various investment vehicles related to real estate from his friends and is seeking a more in-depth understanding of these investments from Wang.Wang begins the meeting by advising Caudill of the many options that are available when investing in real estate, including the following:Option 1 Direct ownership in real estateOption 2 Publicly traded real estate investment trustsOption 3 Publicly traded real estate operating companiesOption 4 Publicly-traded residential mortgage-backed securitiesWang next asks Caudill about his investment preferences. Caudill responds by telling Wang that he prefers to invest in equity securities that are highly liquid, provide high income, and are not subject to double taxation.Caudill asks Wang how the economic performance of REITs and REOCs is evaluated and how their shares are valued. Wang advises Caudill there are multiple measures of economic performance for REITs and REOCs, including the following:Measure 1 Net operating incomeMeasure 2 Funds from operationsMeasure 3 Adjusted funds from operationsIn response, Caudill asks Wang:“Which of the three measures is the best measure of a REIT’s current economic return to shareholders?”To help Caudill’s understanding of valuation, Wang presents Caudill with data on Baldwin, a health care REIT that primarily invests in independent and assisted senior housing communities in large cities across the United States.

NWC's strategy uses a fixed-weighting scheme to allocate exposure among 12 commodities, and it is benchmarked against the Thomson/Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index (TR/CC CRB). Nabli manages the energy and livestock sectors with the help of Sota Yamata, a junior analyst.Nabli and Yamata meet to discuss a variety of factors that affect commodity values in the two sectors they manage. Yamata tells Nabli the following:Statement 1 Storage costs are negatively related to futures prices.Statement 2 In contrast to stocks and bonds, most commodity investments are made by using derivatives.Statement 3 Commodities generate future cash flows beyond what can be realized through their purchase and sale.Nabli and Yamata then discuss potential new investments in the energy sector. They review Brent crude oil futures data, which are presented in Exhibit 1.

Yamata presents his research related to the energy sector, which has the following conclusions:■ Consumers have been more concerned about prices than producers have.■ Energy is consumed on a real-time basis and requires minimal storage.After concluding the discussion of the energy sector, Nabli reviews the performance of NWC's long position in lean hog futures contracts. Nabli notes that the portfolio earned a –12% price return on the lean hog futures position last year and a –24% roll return after the contracts were rolled forward. The position was held with collateral equal to 100% of the position at a risk-free rate of 1.2% per year.Yamata asks Nabli to clarify how the state of the futures market affects roll returns. Nabli responds as follows:Statement 4 Roll returns are generally negative when a futures market is in contango.Statement 5 Roll returns are generally positive when a futures market is in backwardation.As part of their expansion into new markets, NWC is considering changing its benchmark index. Nabli investigates two indexes as a possible replacement. These indexes both use similar weighting and rebalancing schemes. Index A includes con-tracts of commodities typically in contango, whereas Index B includes contracts of commodities typically in backwardation. Nabli asks Yamata how the two indexes perform relative to each other in a market that is trending upward.Because of a substantial decline in drilling activity in the North Sea, Nabli believes the price of Brent crude oil will increase more than that of heavy crude oil. The actual price volatility of Brent crude oil has been lower than its expected volatility, and Nabli expects this trend to continue. Nabli also expects the level of the ICE Brent Index to increase from its current level. Nabli and Yamata discuss how to use swaps to take advantage of Nabli's expectations. The possible positions are (1) a basis swap long on Brent crude oil and short on heavy crude oil, (2) a long volatility swap on Brent crude oil, and (3) a short position in an excess return swap that is based on a fixed level (i.e., the current level) of the ICE Brent Index.

13,"Martha Brady is the CIO of the Upper Darby County (UDC) public employees’ pension system. Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity. She has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more information about the workings of the private equity market.Brady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity investments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major differences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from venture capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded or even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital and buyout investments.Chau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the managers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are inserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish managers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.One concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some funds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of investment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the distribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such provision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited partners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution mechanism is called the total return waterfall.Chau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the funds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits from its first three projects during a three-year period.
| Exhibit l.Investment Returns and Distribution Waterfalls |
| Private equity committed capital | $ 400 million |
| Carried interest | 20% |
| First project investment capital | $20mllon |
| Second project investment capital | $45mllon |
| Third project investment capital | $50mllon |
| Proceeds from first project | $25mllion |
| Proceeds from second project | $ 35 million |
| Proceeds from third project | $65mllon |


Chau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance of private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the awareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s life. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds, diversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years remaining to termination.
| Exhibit 2.Financial Performance of Alpha， Beta， and Gamma Funds |
| Fund | PIC | DPI | RVP I |
| Alpha | 0.30 | 0.10 | 0.65 |
| Beta | 0.85 | 0.10 | 1.25 |
| Gamma | 0.85 | 1.25 | 0.75 |


Chau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to outperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a relatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the remaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the rest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is already as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the proportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to Beta and Gamma.Hermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit from an investment is vital for the fund’s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, take special care to plan their exits.Brady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value investments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned about buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be used to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new investors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?Hermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity transactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.Statement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed on the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.Statement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary method of valuation.Statement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are used frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.
For the projects described in Exhibit 1, under a deal-by-deal method with a clawback provision and true-up every three years, the cumulative dollar amount the GP receives by the end of the three years is equal to:",1 million.,2 million.,3 million.,,B

Menlo Bank recently released a report on the coffee market. Brown shares the key conclusion from the report with Musicale: “The coffee market had a global harvest that was greater than expected. Despite the large harvest, coffee futures trading activity is balanced between producers and consumers. This balanced condition is not expected to change over the next year”Brown shows Musicale the total return of a recent trade executed by the Apex Fund. Brown explains that the Apex Fund took a fully collateralized long futures position in nearby soybean futures contracts at the quoted futures price of 865.0 (US cents/bushel). Three months later, the entire futures position was rolled when the near-term futures price was 877.0 and the farther-term futures price was 883.0. During the three-month period between the time that the initial long position was taken and the rolling of the contract, the collateral earned an annualized rate of 0.60%.Brown tells Musicale that the pension fund could alternatively gain long exposure to commodities using the swap market.

24,"Daniel Collin is a junior analyst at JRR Equity Partners, a private equity firm. Collin is assigned to work with Susan Tseng, a senior portfolio manager. Tseng and Collin meet to discuss existing and potential investments.Tseng starts the meeting with a discussion of LBO firms and VC firms. Collin tells Tseng,LBO firms tend to invest in companies with predicable cash flows and experienced management teams, whereas VC firms tend to invest in companies with high EBITDA or EBIT growth and where an exit is fairly predictable.Tseng and Collin next analyze a potential investment in the leveraged buyout of Stoneham Industries. Specifically, they assess the expected gain if they elect to purchase all the preference shares and 90% of the common equity in the LBO. Details of the LBO include the following:●The buyout requires an initial investment of $10 million.●Financing for the deal includes $6 million in debt, $3.6 million in preference shares that promise a 15% annual return paid at exit, and $0.4 million in common equity.The expected exit value in six years is $15 million, with an estimated reduction in debt of $2.8 million over the six years prior to exit.Tseng and Collin next discuss JRR's investment in Venture Holdings, a private equity fund. Selected details on the Venture Holdings fund include the following:●Total committed capital is $115 million.●The distribution waterfall follows the deal-by-deal method, and carried interest is 20%.●On its first exit event a few years ago, the fund generated a $10 million profit.●At the end of the most recent year, cumulative paid-in capital was $98 million, cumulative distributions paid out to LPs were $28 million, and the year-end NAV, before and after distributions, was $170.52 million and $131.42 million, respectively.●Tseng and Collin estimate that the fund's NAV before distributions will be $242.32 million at the end of next year.Finally, Tseng and Collin evaluate two venture capital funds for potential investment: the Squire Fund and the Treble Fund. Both funds are in Year 7 of an estimated 10-year term. Selected data for the two funds are presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Selected Data for the Squire Fund and the Treble Fund |

| RVP I | 0.95 | 0.51 |
| Gross IRR | -11% | 10% |
| Net IRR | -20% | 8% |


After reviewing the performance data in Exhibit 1, Collin draws the following conclusions:Conclusion 1 The unrealized return on investment for the Squire Fund is greater than the unrealized return on investment for the Treble Fund.Conclusion 2 The TVPI for the Treble Fund is higher than the TVPI for the Squire Fund because the Treble Fund has a higher gross IRR.
At the end of the most recent year, the total value to paid-in capital (TVPI) ratio for the Venture Holdings fund was closest to:",0.29x.,1.34x.,1.63x.,,C

Wang advises Caudill there are multiple measures of economic performance for REITs and REOCs, including the following:Measure 1 Net operating incomeMeasure 2 Funds from operationsMeasure 3 Adjusted funds from operationsIn response, Caudill asks Wang:“Which of the three measures is the best measure of a REIT’s current economic return to shareholders?”To help Caudill’s understanding of valuation, Wang presents Caudill with data on Baldwin, a health care REIT that primarily invests in independent and assisted senior housing communities in large cities across the United States. Selected financial data on Baldwin for the past two years are provided in Exhibit 1.

26,"Jamal Nabli is a portfolio manager at NextWave Commodities (NWC), a commodity-based hedge fund located in the United States. NWC's strategy uses a fixed-weighting scheme to allocate exposure among 12 commodities, and it is benchmarked against the Thomson/Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index (TR/CC CRB). Nabli manages the energy and livestock sectors with the help of Sota Yamata, a junior analyst.Nabli and Yamata meet to discuss a variety of factors that affect commodity values in the two sectors they manage. Yamata tells Nabli the following:Statement 1 Storage costs are negatively related to futures prices.Statement 2 In contrast to stocks and bonds, most commodity investments are made by using derivatives.Statement 3 Commodities generate future cash flows beyond what can be realized through their purchase and sale.Nabli and Yamata then discuss potential new investments in the energy sector. They review Brent crude oil futures data, which are presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1 | Selected Data on Brent Crude Oil Futures |
| Near-Term Futures | Longer-Term Futures |
| Spot Price | Price | Price |
| 77.56 | 73.64 | 73.59 |


Yamata presents his research related to the energy sector, which has the following conclusions:■ Consumers have been more concerned about prices than producers have.■ Energy is consumed on a real-time basis and requires minimal storage.After concluding the discussion of the energy sector, Nabli reviews the performance of NWC's long position in lean hog futures contracts. Nabli notes that the portfolio earned a –12% price return on the lean hog futures position last year and a –24% roll return after the contracts were rolled forward. The position was held with collateral equal to 100% of the position at a risk-free rate of 1.2% per year.Yamata asks Nabli to clarify how the state of the futures market affects roll returns. Nabli responds as follows:Statement 4 Roll returns are generally negative when a futures market is in contango.Statement 5 Roll returns are generally positive when a futures market is in backwardation.As part of their expansion into new markets, NWC is considering changing its benchmark index. Nabli investigates two indexes as a possible replacement. These indexes both use similar weighting and rebalancing schemes. Index A includes con-tracts of commodities typically in contango, whereas Index B includes contracts of commodities typically in backwardation. Nabli asks Yamata how the two indexes perform relative to each other in a market that is trending upward.Because of a substantial decline in drilling activity in the North Sea, Nabli believes the price of Brent crude oil will increase more than that of heavy crude oil. The actual price volatility of Brent crude oil has been lower than its expected volatility, and Nabli expects this trend to continue. Nabli also expects the level of the ICE Brent Index to increase from its current level. Nabli and Yamata discuss how to use swaps to take advantage of Nabli's expectations. The possible positions are (1) a basis swap long on Brent crude oil and short on heavy crude oil, (2) a long volatility swap on Brent crude oil, and (3) a short position in an excess return swap that is based on a fixed level (i.e., the current level) of the ICE Brent Index.
Based on Exhibit 1, Yamata should conclude that the:",calendar spread for Brent crude oil is $3.97.,Brent crude oil futures market is in backwardation.,basis for the near-term Brent crude oil futures contract is $0.05 per barrel.,,B

As part of the review, Tang asks Rodriguez to evaluate financing alternatives to determine if it would be better to use debt financing or to make an all cash purchase. Tang directs Rodriguez to inquire about terms with Richmond Life Insurance Company, a publicly traded company, which is an active lender on commercial real estate property. Rodriquez obtains the following information from Richmond Life for a loan on Property #1: loan term of 5 years, interest rate of 5.75% interest-only, maximum loan to value of 75%, and minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.5x.After reviewing her research materials, Rodriguez formulates the following two conclusions:Conclusion 1Benefits of private equity real estate investments include owners’ ability to attain diversification benefits, to earn current income, and to achieve tax benefits.Conclusion 2Risk factors of private equity real estate investments include business conditions, demographics, the cost of debt and equity capital, and financial leverage.
Assuming an appraised value of $48 million, Richmond Life Insurance Company’s maximum loan amount on Property 1 would be closest to:",$32 million.,$36 million.,$45 million.,,A
28,"Raffi Musicale is the portfolio manager for a defined benefit pension plan. He meets with Jenny Brown, market strategist with Menlo Bank, to discuss possible investment opportunities. The investment committee for the pension plan has recently approved expanding the plan's permitted asset mix to include alternative asset classes.Brown proposes the Apex Commodity Fund (Apex Fund) offered by Menlo Bank as a potentially suitable investment for the pension plan. The Apex Fund attempts to produce trading profits by capitalizing on the mispricing between the spot and futures prices of commodities. The fund has access to storage facilities, allowing it to take delivery of commodities when necessary. The Apex Fund's current asset allocation is presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l Apex Fund's Asset Allocation |
| Commodity Sector | Allocation(%) |
| Energy | 31.9 |
| Livestock | 12.6 |
| Softs | 21.7 |
| Precious metals | 33.8 |


Brown explains that the Apex Fund has had historically low correlations with stocks and bonds, resulting in diversification benefits. Musicale asks Brown, “Can you identify a factor that affects the valuation of financial assets like stocks and bonds but does not affect the valuation of commodities?”Brown shares selected futures contract data for three markets in which the Apex Fund invests. The futures data are presented in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2 Selected Commodity Futures Data* |
| Month | Gold Price | Coffee Price | Gasoline Price |
| July | 1，301.2 | 09600 | 2.2701 |
| September | 1，301.2 | 0.9795 | 2.2076 |
| December | 1，301.2 | 1.0055 | 2.0307 |


Menlo Bank recently released a report on the coffee market. Brown shares the key conclusion from the report with Musicale: “The coffee market had a global harvest that was greater than expected. Despite the large harvest, coffee futures trading activity is balanced between producers and consumers. This balanced condition is not expected to change over the next year”Brown shows Musicale the total return of a recent trade executed by the Apex Fund. Brown explains that the Apex Fund took a fully collateralized long futures position in nearby soybean futures contracts at the quoted futures price of 865.0 (US cents/bushel). Three months later, the entire futures position was rolled when the near-term futures price was 877.0 and the farther-term futures price was 883.0. During the three-month period between the time that the initial long position was taken and the rolling of the contract, the collateral earned an annualized rate of 0.60%.Brown tells Musicale that the pension fund could alternatively gain long exposure to commodities using the swap market. Brown and Musicale analyze the performance of a long position in an S&P GSCI total return swap having monthly resets and a notional amount of $25 million. Selected data on the S&P GSCI are presented in Exhibit 3.

Tseng and Collin meet to discuss existing and potential investments.Tseng starts the meeting with a discussion of LBO firms and VC firms. Collin tells Tseng,LBO firms tend to invest in companies with predicable cash flows and experienced management teams, whereas VC firms tend to invest in companies with high EBITDA or EBIT growth and where an exit is fairly predictable.Tseng and Collin next analyze a potential investment in the leveraged buyout of Stoneham Industries. Specifically, they assess the expected gain if they elect to purchase all the preference shares and 90% of the common equity in the LBO. Details of the LBO include the following:●The buyout requires an initial investment of $10 million.●Financing for the deal includes $6 million in debt, $3.6 million in preference shares that promise a 15% annual return paid at exit, and $0.4 million in common equity.The expected exit value in six years is $15 million, with an estimated reduction in debt of $2.8 million over the six years prior to exit.Tseng and Collin next discuss JRR's investment in Venture Holdings, a private equity fund. Selected details on the Venture Holdings fund include the following:●Total committed capital is $115 million.●The distribution waterfall follows the deal-by-deal method, and carried interest is 20%.●On its first exit event a few years ago, the fund generated a $10 million profit.●At the end of the most recent year, cumulative paid-in capital was $98 million, cumulative distributions paid out to LPs were $28 million, and the year-end NAV, before and after distributions, was $170.52 million and $131.42 million, respectively.●Tseng and Collin estimate that the fund's NAV before distributions will be $242.32 million at the end of next year.Finally, Tseng and Collin evaluate two venture capital funds for potential investment: the Squire Fund and the Treble Fund. Both funds are in Year 7 of an estimated 10-year term. Selected data for the two funds are presented in Exhibit 1.

33,"Martha Brady is the CIO of the Upper Darby County (UDC) public employees’ pension system. Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity. She has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more information about the workings of the private equity market.Brady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity investments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major differences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from venture capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded or even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital and buyout investments.Chau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the managers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are inserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish managers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.One concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some funds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of investment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the distribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such provision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited partners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution mechanism is called the total return waterfall.Chau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the funds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits from its first three projects during a three-year period.
| Exhibit l.Investment Returns and Distribution Waterfalls |
| Private equity committed capital | $ 400 million |
| Carried interest | 20% |
| First project investment capital | $20mllon |
| Second project investment capital | $45mllon |
| Third project investment capital | $50mllon |
| Proceeds from first project | $25mllion |
| Proceeds from second project | $ 35 million |
| Proceeds from third project | $65mllon |


Chau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance of private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the awareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s life. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds, diversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years remaining to termination.
| Exhibit 2.Financial Performance of Alpha， Beta， and Gamma Funds |
| Fund | PIC | DPI | RVP I |
| Alpha | 0.30 | 0.10 | 0.65 |
| Beta | 0.85 | 0.10 | 1.25 |
| Gamma | 0.85 | 1.25 | 0.75 |


Chau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to outperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a relatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the remaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the rest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is already as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the proportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to Beta and Gamma.Hermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit from an investment is vital for the fund’s success.

34,"Hui Lin, CFA is an investment manager looking to diversify his portfolio by adding equity real estate investments. Lin and his investment analyst, Maria Nowak, are discussing whether they should invest in publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) or public real estate operating companies (REOCs). Nowak expresses a strong preference for investing in public REITs in taxable accounts.Lin schedules a meeting to discuss this matter, and for the meeting, Lin asks Nowak to gather data on three specific REITs and come prepared to explain her preference for public REITs over public REOCs. At the meeting, Lin asks Nowak:“Why do you prefer to invest in public REITs over public REOCs for taxable accounts?” Nowak provides Lin with an explanation for her preference of public REITs and provides Lin with data on the three REITs shown in Exhibits 1 and 2.The meeting concludes with Lin directing Nowak to identify the key investment characteristics along with the principal risks of each REIT and to investigate the valuation of the three REITs. Specifically, Lin asks Nowak to value each REIT using four different methodologies:Method 1Net asset valueMethod 2Discounted cash flow valuation using a two-step dividend modelMethod 3Relative valuation using property subsector average P/FFO multipleMethod 4Relative valuation using property subsector average P/AFFO multiple

35,"Martha Brady is the CIO of the Upper Darby County (UDC) public employees’ pension system. Brady is considering an allocation of the pension system’s assets to private equity. She has asked two of her analysts, Jennifer Chau, CFA, and Matthew Hermansky, to provide more information about the workings of the private equity market.Brady recognizes that the private equity asset class covers a broad spectrum of equity investments that are not traded in public markets. She asks Chau to describe the major differences between assets within this asset class. Chau notes that private equity ranges from venture capital financing of early-stage companies to complete buyouts of large publicly traded or even privately held companies. Chau describes some of the characteristics of venture capital and buyout investments.Chau mentions that private equity firms take care to align the economic interests of the managers of the investments they control with their own. Various contractual clauses are inserted in the compensation contracts of the management team in order to reward or punish managers who meet or do not meet agreed-upon target objectives.One concern Chau highlights is the illiquidity of private equity investments over time. Some funds are returned to investors, however, over the life of the fund because a number of investment opportunities are exited early. Provisions in a fund’s prospectus describe the distribution of returns to investors, some of which favor the limited partners. One such provision is the distribution waterfall mechanism that provides distributions to limited partners (LPs) before the general partner (GP) receives the carried interest. This distribution mechanism is called the total return waterfall.Chau prepares the following data to illustrate the distribution waterfall mechanism and the funds provided to limited partners when a private equity fund with a zero hurdle rate exits from its first three projects during a three-year period.
| Exhibit l.Investment Returns and Distribution Waterfalls |
| Private equity committed capital | $ 400 million |
| Carried interest | 20% |
| First project investment capital | $20mllon |
| Second project investment capital | $45mllon |
| Third project investment capital | $50mllon |
| Proceeds from first project | $25mllion |
| Proceeds from second project | $ 35 million |
| Proceeds from third project | $65mllon |


Chau cautions that investors must understand the terminology used to describe the performance of private equity funds. Interpretation of performance numbers should be made with the awareness that much of the fund assets are illiquid during a substantial part of the fund’s life. She provides the latest data in Exhibit 2 for the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Funds, diversified high-technology venture capital funds formed five years ago, each with five years remaining to termination.
| Exhibit 2.Financial Performance of Alpha， Beta， and Gamma Funds |
| Fund | PIC | DPI | RVP I |
| Alpha | 0.30 | 0.10 | 0.65 |
| Beta | 0.85 | 0.10 | 1.25 |
| Gamma | 0.85 | 1.25 | 0.75 |


Chau studies the data and comments, Of the three funds, the Alpha Fund has the best chance to outperform over the remaining life. First, it’s because the management has earned such a relatively high residual value on capital and will be able to earn a high return on the remaining funds called down. At termination, the RVPI will be double the 0.65 value when the rest of the funds are called down. Second, its cash-on-cash return as measured by DPI is already as high as that of the Beta Fund. The PIC (or paid-in capital) ratio indicates the proportion of capital already called by the GP. The PIC of Alpha is relatively low relative to Beta and Gamma.Hermansky notes that a private equity fund’s ability to properly plan and execute its exit from an investment is vital for the fund’s success. Venture funds, such as Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, take special care to plan their exits.Brady then asks the analysts what procedures private equity firms would use to value investments in their portfolios as well as investments that are added later. She is concerned about buying into a fund with existing assets that do not have public market prices that can be used to ascertain value. In such cases, she worries, what if a GP overvalues the assets and new investors in the fund pay more for the fund assets than they are worth?Hermansky makes three statements regarding the valuation methods used in private equity transactions during the early stages of selling a fund to investors.Statement 1: For venture capital investment in the early stages of analysis, emphasis is placed on the discounted cash flow approach to valuation.Statement 2: For buyout investments, income-based approaches are used frequently as a primary method of valuation.Statement 3: If a comparable group of companies exist, multiples of revenues or earnings are used frequently to derive a value for venture capital investments.

NWC's strategy uses a fixed-weighting scheme to allocate exposure among 12 commodities, and it is benchmarked against the Thomson/Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index (TR/CC CRB). Nabli manages the energy and livestock sectors with the help of Sota Yamata, a junior analyst.Nabli and Yamata meet to discuss a variety of factors that affect commodity values in the two sectors they manage. Yamata tells Nabli the following:Statement 1 Storage costs are negatively related to futures prices.Statement 2 In contrast to stocks and bonds, most commodity investments are made by using derivatives.Statement 3 Commodities generate future cash flows beyond what can be realized through their purchase and sale.Nabli and Yamata then discuss potential new investments in the energy sector.

Nabli notes that the portfolio earned a –12% price return on the lean hog futures position last year and a –24% roll return after the contracts were rolled forward. The position was held with collateral equal to 100% of the position at a risk-free rate of 1.2% per year.Yamata asks Nabli to clarify how the state of the futures market affects roll returns. Nabli responds as follows:Statement 4 Roll returns are generally negative when a futures market is in contango.Statement 5 Roll returns are generally positive when a futures market is in backwardation.As part of their expansion into new markets, NWC is considering changing its benchmark index. Nabli investigates two indexes as a possible replacement. These indexes both use similar weighting and rebalancing schemes. Index A includes con-tracts of commodities typically in contango, whereas Index B includes contracts of commodities typically in backwardation. Nabli asks Yamata how the two indexes perform relative to each other in a market that is trending upward.Because of a substantial decline in drilling activity in the North Sea, Nabli believes the price of Brent crude oil will increase more than that of heavy crude oil. The actual price volatility of Brent crude oil has been lower than its expected volatility, and Nabli expects this trend to continue. Nabli also expects the level of the ICE Brent Index to increase from its current level. Nabli and Yamata discuss how to use swaps to take advantage of Nabli's expectations. The possible positions are (1) a basis swap long on Brent crude oil and short on heavy crude oil, (2) a long volatility swap on Brent crude oil, and (3) a short position in an excess return swap that is based on a fixed level (i.e., the current level) of the ICE Brent Index.

42,"Hui Lin, CFA is an investment manager looking to diversify his portfolio by adding equity real estate investments. Lin and his investment analyst, Maria Nowak, are discussing whether they should invest in publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) or public real estate operating companies (REOCs). Nowak expresses a strong preference for investing in public REITs in taxable accounts.Lin schedules a meeting to discuss this matter, and for the meeting, Lin asks Nowak to gather data on three specific REITs and come prepared to explain her preference for public REITs over public REOCs. At the meeting, Lin asks Nowak:“Why do you prefer to invest in public REITs over public REOCs for taxable accounts?” Nowak provides Lin with an explanation for her preference of public REITs and provides Lin with data on the three REITs shown in Exhibits 1 and 2.The meeting concludes with Lin directing Nowak to identify the key investment characteristics along with the principal risks of each REIT and to investigate the valuation of the three REITs. Specifically, Lin asks Nowak to value each REIT using four different methodologies:Method 1Net asset valueMethod 2Discounted cash flow valuation using a two-step dividend modelMethod 3Relative valuation using property subsector average P/FFO multipleMethod 4Relative valuation using property subsector average P/AFFO multiple

43,"Raffi Musicale is the portfolio manager for a defined benefit pension plan. He meets with Jenny Brown, market strategist with Menlo Bank, to discuss possible investment opportunities. The investment committee for the pension plan has recently approved expanding the plan's permitted asset mix to include alternative asset classes.Brown proposes the Apex Commodity Fund (Apex Fund) offered by Menlo Bank as a potentially suitable investment for the pension plan. The Apex Fund attempts to produce trading profits by capitalizing on the mispricing between the spot and futures prices of commodities. The fund has access to storage facilities, allowing it to take delivery of commodities when necessary. The Apex Fund's current asset allocation is presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l Apex Fund's Asset Allocation |
| Commodity Sector | Allocation(%) |
| Energy | 31.9 |
| Livestock | 12.6 |
| Softs | 21.7 |
| Precious metals | 33.8 |


Brown explains that the Apex Fund has had historically low correlations with stocks and bonds, resulting in diversification benefits. Musicale asks Brown, “Can you identify a factor that affects the valuation of financial assets like stocks and bonds but does not affect the valuation of commodities?”Brown shares selected futures contract data for three markets in which the Apex Fund invests. The futures data are presented in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2 Selected Commodity Futures Data* |
| Month | Gold Price | Coffee Price | Gasoline Price |
| July | 1，301.2 | 09600 | 2.2701 |
| September | 1，301.2 | 0.9795 | 2.2076 |
| December | 1，301.2 | 1.0055 | 2.0307 |


Menlo Bank recently released a report on the coffee market. Brown shares the key conclusion from the report with Musicale: “The coffee market had a global harvest that was greater than expected. Despite the large harvest, coffee futures trading activity is balanced between producers and consumers. This balanced condition is not expected to change over the next year”Brown shows Musicale the total return of a recent trade executed by the Apex Fund. Brown explains that the Apex Fund took a fully collateralized long futures position in nearby soybean futures contracts at the quoted futures price of 865.0 (US cents/bushel). Three months later, the entire futures position was rolled when the near-term futures price was 877.0 and the farther-term futures price was 883.0. During the three-month period between the time that the initial long position was taken and the rolling of the contract, the collateral earned an annualized rate of 0.60%.Brown tells Musicale that the pension fund could alternatively gain long exposure to commodities using the swap market. Brown and Musicale analyze the performance of a long position in an S&P GSCI total return swap having monthly resets and a notional amount of $25 million. Selected data on the S&P GSCI are presented in Exhibit 3.
