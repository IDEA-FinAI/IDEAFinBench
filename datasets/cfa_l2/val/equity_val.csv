0,"Elena Castovan is a junior analyst with Contralith Capital, a long-only equity investment manager. She has been asked to value three stocks on Contralith's watch list: Portous, Inc. (PTU), SSX Financial (SSX), and Tantechi Ltd. (TTCI).During their weekly meeting, Castovan and her supervisor, Ariana Beckworth, discuss characteristics of residual income (RI) models. Castovan tells Beckworth the following.Statement 1 The present value of the terminal value in RI models is often a larger portion of the total intrinsic value than it is in other DCF valuation models.Statement 2 The RI model's use of accounting income assumes that the cost of debt capital is appropriately reflected by interest expense.Statement 3 RI models cannot be readily applied to companies that do not have positive expected near-term free cash flows.Beckworth asks Castovan why an RI model may be more appropriate for valuing PTU than the dividend discount model or a free cash flow model. Castovan tells Beckworth that, over her five-year forecast horizon, she expects PTU to perform the following actions.Reason 1 Pay dividends that are unpredictableReason 2 Generate positive and fairly predictable free cash flowsReason 3 Report significant amounts of other comprehensive incomeAt the conclusion of their meeting, Beckworth asks Castovan to value SSX using RI models.

1,"Alan Chin, the chief executive officer of Thunder Corporation, has asked his chief financial officer, Constance Ebinosa, to prepare a valuation of Thunder for the purpose of selling the company to a private investment partnership. Thunder is a profitable $200 million annual sales US domiciled manufacturer of generic household products. Customers consist of several grocery store chains in the United States. Competitors include large companies such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox, and Unilever. Thunder has been in business for 15 years and is privately owned by the original shareholders, none of whom are employed by the company. The company’s senior management has been in charge of the company’s operations for most of the past 15 years and expects to remain in that capacity after any sale.The partnership has expectations about Thunder similar to the current shareholders and management of Thunder. These investors expect to hold Thunder for an intermediate period of time and then bring the company public when market conditions are more favorable than currently.Chin is concerned about what definition of value should be used when analyzing Thunder. He notes that the stock market has been very volatile recently. He also wonders whether fair market value can be realistically estimated when the most similar recent private market transactions may not have been at arm’s length.Chin asks Ebinosa whether there will be differences in the process of valuing a private company like Thunder compared with a public company. Ebinosa replies that differences do exist and mentions several factors an analyst must consider.Ebinosa also explains that several approaches are available for valuing private companies. She mentions that one possibility is to use an asset-based approach because Thunder has a relatively large and efficient factory and warehouse for its products. A real estate appraiser can readily determine the value of these facilities. A second method would be the market approach and using an average of the price-to-earnings multiples for Procter & Gamble and Clorox. A third possibility is a discounted free cash flow approach. The latter would focus on a continuation of Thunder’s trend of slow profitable growth during the past ten years.The private investment partnership has mentioned that they are likely to use an income approach as one of their methods. Ebinosa decides to validate the estimates they make. She assumes for the next 12 months that Thunder’s revenues increase by the long-term annual growth rate of 3 percent. She also makes the following assumptions to calculate the free cash flow to the firm for the next 12 months:● Gross profit margin is 45 percent. ? Depreciation is 2 percent of revenues.● Selling, general, and administrative expenses are 24 percent of revenues.● Capital expenditures equal 125 percent of depreciation to support the current level of revenues.● Additional capital expenditures of 15 percent of incremental revenues are needed to fund future growth.● Working capital investment equals 8 percent of incremental revenues.● Marginal tax rate on EBIT is 35 percent.Chin knows that if an income approach is used then the choice of discount rate may have a large influence on the estimated value. He makes two statements regarding discount rate estimates:1. If the CAPM method is used to estimate the discount rate with a beta estimate based on public companies with operations and revenues similar to Thunder, then a small stock premium should be added to the estimate.2. The weighted average cost of capital of the private investment partnership should be used to value Thunder.Ebinosa decides to calculate a value of Thunder’s equity using the capitalized cash flow method (CCM) and decides to use the build-up method to estimate Thunder’s required return on equity. She makes the following assumptions:● Growth of FCFE is at a constant annual rate of 3 percent.● Free cash flow to equity for the year ahead is $2.5 million.● Risk free rate is 4.5 percent.● Equity risk premium is 5.0 percent.● Size premium is 2.0 percent.
Given Chin’s concerns, the most appropriate definition of value for Thunder is:",intrinsic value.,investment value.,fair market value.,,A
2,"Assorted Fund, a UK-based globally diversified equity mutual fund, is considering adding Talisman Energy Inc. (Toronto Stock Exchange: TLM) to its portfolio. Talisman is an independent upstream oil and gas company headquartered in Calgary, Canada. It is one of the largest oil and gas companies in Canada and has operations in several countries. Brian Dobson, an analyst at the mutual fund, has been assigned the task of estimating a fair value of Talisman. Dobson is aware of several approaches that could be used for this purpose. After carefully considering the characteristics of the company and its competitors, he believes the company will have extraordinary growth for the next few years and normal growth thereafter. So, he has concluded that a two-stage DDM is the most appropriate for valuing the stock.Talisman pays semi-annual dividends. The total dividends during 2006, 2007, and 2008 have been C$0.114, C$0.15, and C$0.175, respectively. These imply a growth rate of 32 percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2008. Dobson believes that the growth rate will be 14 percent in the next year. He has estimated that the first stage will include the next eight years.Dobson is using the CAPM to estimate the required return on equity for Talisman. He has estimated that the beta of Talisman, as measured against the S&P/TSX Composite Index (formerly TSE 300 Composite Index), is 0.84. The Canadian risk-free rate, as measured by the annual yield on the 10-year government bond, is 4.1 percent. The equity risk premium for the Canadian market is estimated at 5.5 percent. Based on these data, Dobson has estimated that the required return on Talisman stock is 0.041 + 0.84(0.055) = 0.0872 or 8.72 percent. Dobson is doing the analysis in January 2009 and the stock price at that time is C$17.Dobson realizes that even within the two-stage DDM, there could be some variations in the approach. He would like to explore how these variations affect the valuation of the stock. Specifically, he wants to estimate the value of the stock for each of the following approaches separately.I. The dividend growth rate will be 14 percent throughout the first stage of eight years. The dividend growth rate thereafter will be 7 percent.II. Instead of using the estimated stable growth rate of 7 percent in the second stage, Dobson wants to use his estimate that eight years later Talisman’s stock will be worth 17 times its earnings per share (trailing P/E of 17). He expects that the earnings retention ratio at that time will be 0.70.III. In contrast to the first approach above in which the growth rate declines abruptly from 14 percent in the eighth year to 7 percent in the ninth, the growth rate would decline linearly from 14 percent in the first year to 7 percent in the ninth.
What is the current value of the stock based on the second approach?",C$16.24.,C$17.65.,C$28.29.,,A
3,"Mark Cannan is updating research reports on two well-established consumer companies before first quarter 2011 earnings reports are released. His supervisor, Sharolyn Ritter, has asked Cannan to use market-based valuations when updating the reports.Delite Beverage is a manufacturer and distributor of soft drinks and recently acquired a major water bottling company in order to offer a broader product line. The acquisition will have a significant impact on Delite’s future results.You Fix It is a United States retail distributor of products for home improvement, primarily for those consumers who choose to do the work themselves. The home improvement industry is cyclical; the industry was adversely affected by the recent downturn in the economy, the level of foreclosures, and slow home sales. Although sales and earnings at You Fix It weakened, same store sales are beginning to improve as consumers undertake more home improvement projects. Poor performing stores were closed, resulting in significant restructuring charges in 2010.Before approving Cannan’s work, Ritter wants to discuss the calculations and choices of ratios used in the valuation of Delite and You Fix It. The data used by Cannan in his analysis is summarized in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Select Financial Data forD elite Beverage and You FixIt |
| Delite Beverage | You FixIt |

| Free cashflow per share | $2.68 | $0.21 |
| Shares outstanding end of year | 2，322，034，000 | 1，638，821，000 |


Cannan advises Ritter that he is considering three different approaches to value the shares of You Fix It:● Approach 1Price-to-book (P/B) ratio● Approach 2Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio using trailing earnings● Approach 3Price-to-earnings ratio using normalized earningsCannan tells Ritter that he calculated the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) for You Fix It, but chose not to use it in the valuation of the shares. Cannan states to Ritter that it is more appropriate to use the P/E ratio rather than the P/S ratio because:● Reason 1Earnings are more stable than sales.● Reason 2Earnings are less easily manipulated than sales.● Reason 3The P/E ratio reflects financial leverage whereas the P/S ratio does not. Cannan also informs Ritter that he did not use a price-to-cash flow multiple in valuing the shares of Delite or You Fix It. The reason is that he could not identify a cash flow measure that would both account for working capital and non-cash revenues, and also be after interest expense and thus not be mismatched with share price.Ritter advises Cannan that such a cash flow measure does exist. Ritter provides Cannan with financial data on three close competitors as well as the overall beverage sector, which includes other competitors, in Exhibit 2. She asks Cannan to determine, based on the price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio, whether Delite shares are overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued.

| Tasty RootBeer | 44.10 | 20% |
| Beverage sector average | 16.40 | 10.80% |


After providing Ritter his answer, Cannan is concerned about the inclusion of Tasty Root Beer in the comparables analysis. Specifically, Cannan asks Ritter:“I feel we should mitigate the effect of large outliers, but not the impact of small outliers (i.e., those close to zero), when calculating the beverage sector P/E. What measure of central tendency would you suggest we use to address this concern?”Ritter requests that Cannan incorporate their discussion points before submitting the reports for final approval.

5,"Guardian Capital is a rapidly growing US investment firm. The Guardian Capital research team is responsible for identifying undervalued and overvalued publicly traded equities that have a market capitalization greater than $500 million.Due to the rapid growth of assets under management, Guardian Capital recently hired a new analyst, Jack Richardson, to support the research process. At the new analyst orientation meeting, the director of research made the following statements about equity valuation at Guardian:Statement 1“Analysts at Guardian Capital seek to identify mispricing, relying on price eventually converging to intrinsic value. However, convergence of the market price to an analyst’s estimate of intrinsic value may not happen within the portfolio manager’s investment time horizon. So, besides evidence of mispricing, analysts should look for the presence of a particular market or corporate event,—that is, a catalyst— that will cause the marketplace to re-evaluate the subject firm’s prospects.”Statement 2“An active investment manager attempts to capture positive alpha. But mispricing of assets is not directly observable. It is therefore important that you understand the possible sources of perceived mispricing.”Statement 3“For its distressed securities fund, Guardian Capital screens its investable universe of securities for companies in financial distress.”Statement 4“For its core equity fund, Guardian Capital selects financially sound companies that are expected to generate significant positive free cash flow from core business operations within a multiyear forecast horizon.”Statement 5“Guardian Capital’s research process requires analysts to evaluate the reasonableness of the expectations implied by the market price by comparing the market’s implied expectations to his or her own expectations.”After the orientation meeting, the director of research asks Richardson to evaluate three companies that are retailers of men’s clothing: Diamond Co., Renaissance Clothing, and Deluxe Men’s Wear.Richardson starts his analysis by evaluating the characteristics of the men’s retail clothing industry. He finds few barriers to new retail entrants, high intra-industry rivalry among retailers, low product substitution costs for customers and a large number of wholesale clothing suppliers.While conducting his analysis, Richardson discovers that Renaissance Clothing included three non-recurring items in their most recent earnings release: a positive litigation settlement, a one-time tax credit, and the gain on the sale of a non-operating asset.To estimate each firm’s intrinsic value, Richardson applies appropriate discount rates to each firm’s estimated free cash flows over a ten-year time horizon and to the estimated value of the firm at the end of the ten-year horizon.Michelle Lee, a junior technology analyst at Guardian, asks the director of research for advice as to which valuation model to use for VEGA, a fast growing semiconductor company that is rapidly gaining market share.The director of research states that “the valuation model selected must be consistent with the characteristics of the company being valued.”Lee tells the director of research that VEGA is not expected to be profitable for several more years. According to management guidance, when the company turns profitable, it will invest in new product development; as a result, it does not expect to initiate a dividend for an extended period of time. Lee also notes that she expects that certain larger competitors will become interested in acquiring VEGA because of its excellent growth prospects. The director of research advises Lee to consider that in her valuation.

6,"BJL Financial provides clients with professional investment management services that are tailored to the specific needs of each client. The firm's portfolio manager, Angelique Kwaza, has called a meeting with the senior analyst, Samira Khan, to discuss the quarterly rebalancing of three client portfolios. The valuation model used in the analyses is the discounted dividend model.● Client 1 has a portfolio with significant exposure to dividend-paying stocks.● Client 2 is interested in including preferred stock in the portfolio.● Client 3 has a growth-oriented equity-only portfolio.Khan has identified two utilities (ABC and XYZ) for possible inclusion in Client l's portfolio, as shown in Exhibit 1. She uses a discount rate of 7% for both common stocks.
| Exhibit 1 | Candidate Stocks for Client 1 |
| Stock | Company Description |
| ABC | MABC is a publicly traded utility with an expected constant growth |
| rate for earnings and dividends of 3.5%. |

| m The common stock price is$10per share. |
| M The current year earnings are$0.45per share， and next year's earn- |
| ings are expected to be$0.50per share. |


Kwaza asks Khan to investigate the most appropriate models for valuing utility companies. She tells Khan about the following points mentioned in various research reports on the utilities sector.● Report 1: A resurgence in domestic manufacturing activity will generate longterm growth in earnings and dividends that exceeds the cost of equity.● Report 2: Share repurchases are expected to increase. The report expresses confidence in the forecasts regarding the magnitude and timing of these repurchases.● Report 3: The report forecasts earnings growth of 4.5%. The key growth drivers are increases in population and business creation associated with stable GDP growth of 2.75%.For Client 2's portfolio, Khan has identified the non-callable perpetual preferred stocks of Standard Company and Main Company.● The Standard Company's preferred stock pays 2.75% on a par value of $100. Khan believes it to be fairly valued at a market price of $49.60.● The perpetual preferred stock of Main Company has a par value of $50 per share and pays an annual dividend of 5.5%. Khan estimates a capitalization rate at 6%. The current market price of Main Company preferred stock is $42.Finally, Khan has identified three stocks, shown in Exhibit 2, as likely candidates for Client 3's portfolio.

French notes that for the year just ended (2019), Archway’s cost of goods sold was 30% of sales. To forecast Archway’s income statement for 2020, French assumes that all companies in the industry will experience an inflation rate of 8% on the cost of goods sold. Exhibit 2 shows French’s forecasts relating to Archway’s price and volume changes.

After putting together income statement projections for Archway, French forecasts Archway’s balance sheet items; He uses Archway’s historical efficiency ratios to forecast the company’s working capital accounts.Based on his financial forecast for Archway, French estimates a terminal value using a valuation multiple based on the company’s average price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) over the past five years. Wright discusses with French how the terminal value estimate is sensitive to key assumptions about the company’s future prospects. Wright asks French:“What change in the calculation of the terminal value would you make if a technological development that would adversely affect Archway was forecast to occur sometime beyond your financial forecast horizon?”

He has developed a stock valuation model for this firm based on its forecasted fundamentals. His revenue growth rate estimate is less than that implied by the market price.Phoneutria’s financial statements over the past five years show strong performance, with above average growth. Santos has decided to use a lower forecasted growth rate in his models, reflecting the effect of “regression to the mean” over time. He notes two reasons for his lower growth rate forecast:Reason 1 Successful companies tend to draw more competition, putting their high profits under pressure.Reason 2 Phoneutria’s intellectual property and franchise agreements will be weakening over time.Santos meets with Walter Hartmann, a newly hired associate in his department. In their conversation, Hartmann states, “Security analysts forecast company performance using both top-down and bottom-up analysis. I can think of three examples:1 A restaurant chain forecasts its sales to be its market share times forecast industry sales.2 An electric utility company forecasts that its sales will grow proportional to increases in GDP.3 A retail furniture company forecasts next year’s sales by assuming that the sales in its newly built stores will have similar sales per square meter to that of its existing stores.”Hartmann is reviewing some possible trades for three stocks in the health care industry based on a pairs-trading strategy. Hartmann’s evaluations are as follows:● HG Health is 15% overvalued.● Corgent Cell Sciences is 10% overvalued.● Johnson Labs is 15% undervalued.

14,"Guardian Capital is a rapidly growing US investment firm. The Guardian Capital research team is responsible for identifying undervalued and overvalued publicly traded equities that have a market capitalization greater than $500 million.Due to the rapid growth of assets under management, Guardian Capital recently hired a new analyst, Jack Richardson, to support the research process. At the new analyst orientation meeting, the director of research made the following statements about equity valuation at Guardian:Statement 1“Analysts at Guardian Capital seek to identify mispricing, relying on price eventually converging to intrinsic value. However, convergence of the market price to an analyst’s estimate of intrinsic value may not happen within the portfolio manager’s investment time horizon. So, besides evidence of mispricing, analysts should look for the presence of a particular market or corporate event,—that is, a catalyst— that will cause the marketplace to re-evaluate the subject firm’s prospects.”Statement 2“An active investment manager attempts to capture positive alpha. But mispricing of assets is not directly observable. It is therefore important that you understand the possible sources of perceived mispricing.”Statement 3“For its distressed securities fund, Guardian Capital screens its investable universe of securities for companies in financial distress.”Statement 4“For its core equity fund, Guardian Capital selects financially sound companies that are expected to generate significant positive free cash flow from core business operations within a multiyear forecast horizon.”Statement 5“Guardian Capital’s research process requires analysts to evaluate the reasonableness of the expectations implied by the market price by comparing the market’s implied expectations to his or her own expectations.”After the orientation meeting, the director of research asks Richardson to evaluate three companies that are retailers of men’s clothing: Diamond Co., Renaissance Clothing, and Deluxe Men’s Wear.Richardson starts his analysis by evaluating the characteristics of the men’s retail clothing industry. He finds few barriers to new retail entrants, high intra-industry rivalry among retailers, low product substitution costs for customers and a large number of wholesale clothing suppliers.While conducting his analysis, Richardson discovers that Renaissance Clothing included three non-recurring items in their most recent earnings release: a positive litigation settlement, a one-time tax credit, and the gain on the sale of a non-operating asset.To estimate each firm’s intrinsic value, Richardson applies appropriate discount rates to each firm’s estimated free cash flows over a ten-year time horizon and to the estimated value of the firm at the end of the ten-year horizon.Michelle Lee, a junior technology analyst at Guardian, asks the director of research for advice as to which valuation model to use for VEGA, a fast growing semiconductor company that is rapidly gaining market share.The director of research states that “the valuation model selected must be consistent with the characteristics of the company being valued.”Lee tells the director of research that VEGA is not expected to be profitable for several more years. According to management guidance, when the company turns profitable, it will invest in new product development; as a result, it does not expect to initiate a dividend for an extended period of time. Lee also notes that she expects that certain larger competitors will become interested in acquiring VEGA because of its excellent growth prospects. The director of research advises Lee to consider that in her valuation.
With respect to Statements 3 and 4, which of the following measures of value would the distressed securities fund’s analyst consider that a core equity fund analyst might ignore?",Fair value,Liquidation value,Fair market value,,B

Izzo’s team first discusses key characteristics of Company A. The company has a history of paying modest dividends relative to FCFE, has a stable capital structure, and is owned by a controlling investor.The team also considers the impact of Company A’s three non-cash transactions in the most recent year on its FCFE, including the following:● Transaction 1: A $900 million loss on a sale of equipment● Transaction 2: An impairment of intangibles of $400 million● Transaction 3: A $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring chargeIn addition, Company A’s annual report indicates that the firm expects to incur additional non-cash charges related to restructuring over the next few years.To value the three companies’ shares, one team member suggests valuing the companies’ shares using net income as a proxy for FCFE. Another team member proposes forecasting FCFE using a sales-based methodology based on the following equation:FCFE = NI – (1 – DR)(FCInv – Dep) – (1 – DR)(WCInv)Izzo’s team ultimately decides to use actual free cash flow to value the three companies’ shares. Selected data and assumptions are provided in Exhibit 2.

Market data:Risk-free rate: 3%Market risk premium: 7%The team calculates the intrinsic value of Company B using a two-stage FCFE model. FCFE growth rates for the first four years are estimated at 10%, 9%, 8%, and 7%, respectively, before declining to a constant 6% starting in the fifth year.To calculate the intrinsic value of Company C’s equity, the team uses the FCFF approach assuming a single-stage model where FCFF is expected to grow at 5% indefinitely.
Based on Exhibits 1 and 2 and the proposed two-stage FCFE model, the intrinsic value of Company B’s equity is closest to:","$70,602 million.","$73,588 million.","$79,596 million.",,C
19,"Assorted Fund, a UK-based globally diversified equity mutual fund, is considering adding Talisman Energy Inc. (Toronto Stock Exchange: TLM) to its portfolio. Talisman is an independent upstream oil and gas company headquartered in Calgary, Canada. It is one of the largest oil and gas companies in Canada and has operations in several countries. Brian Dobson, an analyst at the mutual fund, has been assigned the task of estimating a fair value of Talisman. Dobson is aware of several approaches that could be used for this purpose. After carefully considering the characteristics of the company and its competitors, he believes the company will have extraordinary growth for the next few years and normal growth thereafter. So, he has concluded that a two-stage DDM is the most appropriate for valuing the stock.Talisman pays semi-annual dividends. The total dividends during 2006, 2007, and 2008 have been C$0.114, C$0.15, and C$0.175, respectively. These imply a growth rate of 32 percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2008. Dobson believes that the growth rate will be 14 percent in the next year. He has estimated that the first stage will include the next eight years.Dobson is using the CAPM to estimate the required return on equity for Talisman. He has estimated that the beta of Talisman, as measured against the S&P/TSX Composite Index (formerly TSE 300 Composite Index), is 0.84. The Canadian risk-free rate, as measured by the annual yield on the 10-year government bond, is 4.1 percent. The equity risk premium for the Canadian market is estimated at 5.5 percent. Based on these data, Dobson has estimated that the required return on Talisman stock is 0.041 + 0.84(0.055) = 0.0872 or 8.72 percent. Dobson is doing the analysis in January 2009 and the stock price at that time is C$17.Dobson realizes that even within the two-stage DDM, there could be some variations in the approach. He would like to explore how these variations affect the valuation of the stock. Specifically, he wants to estimate the value of the stock for each of the following approaches separately.I. The dividend growth rate will be 14 percent throughout the first stage of eight years. The dividend growth rate thereafter will be 7 percent.II. Instead of using the estimated stable growth rate of 7 percent in the second stage, Dobson wants to use his estimate that eight years later Talisman’s stock will be worth 17 times its earnings per share (trailing P/E of 17). He expects that the earnings retention ratio at that time will be 0.70.III. In contrast to the first approach above in which the growth rate declines abruptly from 14 percent in the eighth year to 7 percent in the ninth, the growth rate would decline linearly from 14 percent in the first year to 7 percent in the ninth.
What is the terminal value of the stock based on the first approach?",C$17.65.,C$31.06.,C$33.09.,,B

Pinho asks Flávia Silveira, a junior analyst, to complete an analysis of Adesivo S.A., Enviado S.A., and Gesticular S.A.Pinho directs Silveira to use a valuation metric that would allow for a meaningful ranking of relative value of the three companies’ shares. Exhibit 1 provides selected financial information for the three companies.
| Exhibit l.Selected Financial Information for Adesivo, Enviado, and Ges ticular |
| Adesivo | Enviado | Ges ticular |
| Stock's current price | 14.72 | 72.20 | 132.16 |

| Diluted EPS(next four quarters) | 0.91 | 3.10 | 2.85 |
| Dividend rate(annualized most recent dividend) | 0.44 | 1.24 | 0.00 |


Silveira reviews underlying trailing EPS for Adesivo. Adesivo has basic trailing EPS of R$0.84. Silveira finds the following note in Adesivo’s financial statements:“On a per share basis, Adesivo incurred in the last four quartersi. from a lawsuit, a non-recurring gain of R$0.04; andii. from factory integration, a non-recurring cost of R$0.03 and a recurring cost of R$0.01 in increased depreciation.” Silveira notes that Adesivo is forecasted to pay semiannual dividends of R$0.24 next year.Silveira estimates five-year earnings growth rates for the three companies, which are presented in Exhibit 2.

| Adesivo | 16.67 |
| Enviado | 21.91 |

Pinho asks Silveira about the possible use of the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) in assessing the relative value of the three companies. Silveira tells Pinho:● Statement 1The P/S is not affected by revenue recognition practices.● Statement 2The P/S is less subject to distortion from expense accounting than is the P/E. Pinho asks Silveira about using the Fed and Yardeni models to assess the value of the equity market. Silveira states:● Statement 3The Fed model concludes that the market is undervalued when the market’s current earnings yield is greater than the 10-year Treasury bond yield.● Statement 4The Yardeni model includes the consensus five-year earnings growth rate forecast for the market index. Silveira also analyzes the three companies using the enterprising value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple.Silveira notes that the EBITDA for Gesticular for the most recent year is R$560 million and gathers other selected information on Gesticular, which is presented in Exhibit 4.

Pinho asks Silveira about the use of momentum indicators in assessing the shares of the three companies. Silveira states:● Statement 5Relative-strength indicators compare an equity’s performance during a period with the performance of some group of equities or its own past performance.● Statement 6In the calculation of standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), the magnitude of unexpected earnings is typically scaled by the standard deviation of analysts’ earnings forecasts.

21,"Nigel French, an analyst at Taurus Investment Management, is analyzing Archway Technologies, a manufacturer of luxury electronic auto equipment, at the request of his supervisor, Lukas Wright. French is asked to evaluate Archway’s profitability over the past five years relative to its two main competitors, which are located in different countries with significantly different tax structures.French begins by assessing Archway’s competitive position within the luxury electronic auto equipment industry using Porter’s five forces framework. A summary of French’s industry analysis is presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit-l…Analysis of-Luxury Electronic-Auto Equipment-Industry Using Porter's |
| Force | Factors to Consider |
| Threat of substitutes | Customer switching costs are high |
| Rivalry | Archway holds 60%of world market-share； each of its two main |
| competitors holds 15% |
| Bargaining power of | Primary inputs are considered basic commodities， and there area |
| suppliers | large number of suppliers |
| Bargaining power of Luxury electronic-auto-equipment-is-very-specialized-(non- |
| buyers | standardized) |
| Threat of new entrants | High-fixed costs to enter industry |


French notes that for the year just ended (2019), Archway’s cost of goods sold was 30% of sales. To forecast Archway’s income statement for 2020, French assumes that all companies in the industry will experience an inflation rate of 8% on the cost of goods sold. Exhibit 2 shows French’s forecasts relating to Archway’s price and volume changes.
| Exhibit 2.Archway's 2020-Forecasted-Price and Volume Changes |
| Average price increase per unit5.00%Volume growth-3.00% |


After putting together income statement projections for Archway, French forecasts Archway’s balance sheet items; He uses Archway’s historical efficiency ratios to forecast the company’s working capital accounts.Based on his financial forecast for Archway, French estimates a terminal value using a valuation multiple based on the company’s average price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) over the past five years. Wright discusses with French how the terminal value estimate is sensitive to key assumptions about the company’s future prospects. Wright asks French:“What change in the calculation of the terminal value would you make if a technological development that would adversely affect Archway was forecast to occur sometime beyond your financial forecast horizon?”
Based on the current competitive landscape presented in 1, French should conclude that Archway’s ability to:",pass along price increases is high.,demand lower input prices from suppliers is low.,generate above-average returns on invested capital is low.,,A
22,"Elena Castovan is a junior analyst with Contralith Capital, a long-only equity investment manager. She has been asked to value three stocks on Contralith's watch list: Portous, Inc. (PTU), SSX Financial (SSX), and Tantechi Ltd. (TTCI).During their weekly meeting, Castovan and her supervisor, Ariana Beckworth, discuss characteristics of residual income (RI) models. Castovan tells Beckworth the following.Statement 1 The present value of the terminal value in RI models is often a larger portion of the total intrinsic value than it is in other DCF valuation models.Statement 2 The RI model's use of accounting income assumes that the cost of debt capital is appropriately reflected by interest expense.Statement 3 RI models cannot be readily applied to companies that do not have positive expected near-term free cash flows.Beckworth asks Castovan why an RI model may be more appropriate for valuing PTU than the dividend discount model or a free cash flow model. Castovan tells Beckworth that, over her five-year forecast horizon, she expects PTU to perform the following actions.Reason 1 Pay dividends that are unpredictableReason 2 Generate positive and fairly predictable free cash flowsReason 3 Report significant amounts of other comprehensive incomeAt the conclusion of their meeting, Beckworth asks Castovan to value SSX using RI models.

(PTU), SSX Financial (SSX), and Tantechi Ltd. (TTCI).During their weekly meeting, Castovan and her supervisor, Ariana Beckworth, discuss characteristics of residual income (RI) models. Castovan tells Beckworth the following.Statement 1 The present value of the terminal value in RI models is often a larger portion of the total intrinsic value than it is in other DCF valuation models.Statement 2 The RI model's use of accounting income assumes that the cost of debt capital is appropriately reflected by interest expense.Statement 3 RI models cannot be readily applied to companies that do not have positive expected near-term free cash flows.Beckworth asks Castovan why an RI model may be more appropriate for valuing PTU than the dividend discount model or a free cash flow model. Castovan tells Beckworth that, over her five-year forecast horizon, she expects PTU to perform the following actions.Reason 1 Pay dividends that are unpredictableReason 2 Generate positive and fairly predictable free cash flowsReason 3 Report significant amounts of other comprehensive incomeAt the conclusion of their meeting, Beckworth asks Castovan to value SSX using RI models. Selected financial information on SSX is presented in Exhibit 1.

| Cost of equity | 15.00% |
| Market price per share | 448.80 |

For the multistage model, Castovan forecasts TTCI's ROE to be higher than its long-term ROE for the first three years. Forecasted earnings per share and dividends per share for TTCI are presented in Exhibit 3. Starting in Year 4, Castovan forecasts TTCI's ROE to revert to the constant long-term ROE of 12% annually. The terminal value is based on an assumption that residual income per share will be constant from Year 3 into perpetuity.

28,"Guardian Capital is a rapidly growing US investment firm. The Guardian Capital research team is responsible for identifying undervalued and overvalued publicly traded equities that have a market capitalization greater than $500 million.Due to the rapid growth of assets under management, Guardian Capital recently hired a new analyst, Jack Richardson, to support the research process. At the new analyst orientation meeting, the director of research made the following statements about equity valuation at Guardian:Statement 1“Analysts at Guardian Capital seek to identify mispricing, relying on price eventually converging to intrinsic value. However, convergence of the market price to an analyst’s estimate of intrinsic value may not happen within the portfolio manager’s investment time horizon. So, besides evidence of mispricing, analysts should look for the presence of a particular market or corporate event,—that is, a catalyst— that will cause the marketplace to re-evaluate the subject firm’s prospects.”Statement 2“An active investment manager attempts to capture positive alpha. But mispricing of assets is not directly observable. It is therefore important that you understand the possible sources of perceived mispricing.”Statement 3“For its distressed securities fund, Guardian Capital screens its investable universe of securities for companies in financial distress.”Statement 4“For its core equity fund, Guardian Capital selects financially sound companies that are expected to generate significant positive free cash flow from core business operations within a multiyear forecast horizon.”Statement 5“Guardian Capital’s research process requires analysts to evaluate the reasonableness of the expectations implied by the market price by comparing the market’s implied expectations to his or her own expectations.”After the orientation meeting, the director of research asks Richardson to evaluate three companies that are retailers of men’s clothing: Diamond Co., Renaissance Clothing, and Deluxe Men’s Wear.Richardson starts his analysis by evaluating the characteristics of the men’s retail clothing industry. He finds few barriers to new retail entrants, high intra-industry rivalry among retailers, low product substitution costs for customers and a large number of wholesale clothing suppliers.While conducting his analysis, Richardson discovers that Renaissance Clothing included three non-recurring items in their most recent earnings release: a positive litigation settlement, a one-time tax credit, and the gain on the sale of a non-operating asset.To estimate each firm’s intrinsic value, Richardson applies appropriate discount rates to each firm’s estimated free cash flows over a ten-year time horizon and to the estimated value of the firm at the end of the ten-year horizon.Michelle Lee, a junior technology analyst at Guardian, asks the director of research for advice as to which valuation model to use for VEGA, a fast growing semiconductor company that is rapidly gaining market share.The director of research states that “the valuation model selected must be consistent with the characteristics of the company being valued.”Lee tells the director of research that VEGA is not expected to be profitable for several more years. According to management guidance, when the company turns profitable, it will invest in new product development; as a result, it does not expect to initiate a dividend for an extended period of time. Lee also notes that she expects that certain larger competitors will become interested in acquiring VEGA because of its excellent growth prospects. The director of research advises Lee to consider that in her valuation.
Based on Richardson’s industry analysis, which of the following characteristics of men’s retail clothing retailing would positively affect its profitability? That industry’s:",entry costs.,substitution costs.,number of suppliers.,,C

Silveira reviews underlying trailing EPS for Adesivo. Adesivo has basic trailing EPS of R$0.84. Silveira finds the following note in Adesivo’s financial statements:“On a per share basis, Adesivo incurred in the last four quartersi. from a lawsuit, a non-recurring gain of R$0.04; andii. from factory integration, a non-recurring cost of R$0.03 and a recurring cost of R$0.01 in increased depreciation.” Silveira notes that Adesivo is forecasted to pay semiannual dividends of R$0.24 next year.Silveira estimates five-year earnings growth rates for the three companies, which are presented in Exhibit 2.

Pinho asks Silveira about the possible use of the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) in assessing the relative value of the three companies. Silveira tells Pinho:● Statement 1The P/S is not affected by revenue recognition practices.● Statement 2The P/S is less subject to distortion from expense accounting than is the P/E. Pinho asks Silveira about using the Fed and Yardeni models to assess the value of the equity market. Silveira states:● Statement 3The Fed model concludes that the market is undervalued when the market’s current earnings yield is greater than the 10-year Treasury bond yield.● Statement 4The Yardeni model includes the consensus five-year earnings growth rate forecast for the market index. Silveira also analyzes the three companies using the enterprising value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple.Silveira notes that the EBITDA for Gesticular for the most recent year is R$560 million and gathers other selected information on Gesticular, which is presented in Exhibit 4.

Izzo’s team first discusses key characteristics of Company A. The company has a history of paying modest dividends relative to FCFE, has a stable capital structure, and is owned by a controlling investor.The team also considers the impact of Company A’s three non-cash transactions in the most recent year on its FCFE, including the following:● Transaction 1: A $900 million loss on a sale of equipment● Transaction 2: An impairment of intangibles of $400 million● Transaction 3: A $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring chargeIn addition, Company A’s annual report indicates that the firm expects to incur additional non-cash charges related to restructuring over the next few years.To value the three companies’ shares, one team member suggests valuing the companies’ shares using net income as a proxy for FCFE. Another team member proposes forecasting FCFE using a sales-based methodology based on the following equation:FCFE = NI – (1 – DR)(FCInv – Dep) – (1 – DR)(WCInv)Izzo’s team ultimately decides to use actual free cash flow to value the three companies’ shares.

31,"Nigel French, an analyst at Taurus Investment Management, is analyzing Archway Technologies, a manufacturer of luxury electronic auto equipment, at the request of his supervisor, Lukas Wright. French is asked to evaluate Archway’s profitability over the past five years relative to its two main competitors, which are located in different countries with significantly different tax structures.French begins by assessing Archway’s competitive position within the luxury electronic auto equipment industry using Porter’s five forces framework. A summary of French’s industry analysis is presented in Exhibit 1.

French notes that for the year just ended (2019), Archway’s cost of goods sold was 30% of sales. To forecast Archway’s income statement for 2020, French assumes that all companies in the industry will experience an inflation rate of 8% on the cost of goods sold. Exhibit 2 shows French’s forecasts relating to Archway’s price and volume changes.

After putting together income statement projections for Archway, French forecasts Archway’s balance sheet items; He uses Archway’s historical efficiency ratios to forecast the company’s working capital accounts.Based on his financial forecast for Archway, French estimates a terminal value using a valuation multiple based on the company’s average price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) over the past five years. Wright discusses with French how the terminal value estimate is sensitive to key assumptions about the company’s future prospects. Wright asks French:“What change in the calculation of the terminal value would you make if a technological development that would adversely affect Archway was forecast to occur sometime beyond your financial forecast horizon?”

I recommend you use an FCFF model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using an FCFE model because Holt has had a history of leverage changes in the past.”4 “In the last three years, about 5% of Holt’s growth in FCFE has come from decreases in inventory.”Leigh responds to each of Smith’s points as follows:1 “I will use your estimates and calculate Emerald’s long-term, sustainable dividend growth rate.”2 “There are two reasons why I used the FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using a DDM. The first reason is that Holt’s dividends have differed significantly from its capacity to pay dividends. The second reason is that Holt is a takeover target and once the company is taken over, the new owners will have discretion over the uses of free cash flow.”3 “I will calculate Holt’s FCFF for 2020 and estimate the value of Holt’s common stock using an FCFF model.”4 “Holt is a growing company.

Lee also notes that she expects that certain larger competitors will become interested in acquiring VEGA because of its excellent growth prospects. The director of research advises Lee to consider that in her valuation.
Which valuation model would the director of research most likely recommend Lee use to estimate the value of VEGA?",Free cash flow,Dividend discount,P/E relative valuation,,A

Leigh presents his valuations of the common stock of Emerald and Holt to his supervisor, Alice Smith. Smith has the following questions and comments:1 “I estimate that Emerald’s long-term expected dividend payout rate is 20% and its return on equity is 10% over the long term.”2 “Why did you use an FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock? Can you use a DDM instead?”3 “How did Holt’s FCFE for 2020 compare with its FCFF for the same year? I recommend you use an FCFF model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using an FCFE model because Holt has had a history of leverage changes in the past.”4 “In the last three years, about 5% of Holt’s growth in FCFE has come from decreases in inventory.”Leigh responds to each of Smith’s points as follows:1 “I will use your estimates and calculate Emerald’s long-term, sustainable dividend growth rate.”2 “There are two reasons why I used the FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using a DDM. The first reason is that Holt’s dividends have differed significantly from its capacity to pay dividends. The second reason is that Holt is a takeover target and once the company is taken over, the new owners will have discretion over the uses of free cash flow.”3 “I will calculate Holt’s FCFF for 2020 and estimate the value of Holt’s common stock using an FCFF model.”4 “Holt is a growing company. In forecasting either Holt’s FCFE or FCFF growth rates, I will not consider decreases in inventory to be a long-term source of growth.”
Do the reasons provided by Leigh support his use of the FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using a DDM?",Yes.,"No, because Holt’s dividend situation argues in favor of using the DDM.","No, because FCFE is not appropriate for investors taking a control perspective.",,A

39,"Mark Cannan is updating research reports on two well-established consumer companies before first quarter 2011 earnings reports are released. His supervisor, Sharolyn Ritter, has asked Cannan to use market-based valuations when updating the reports.Delite Beverage is a manufacturer and distributor of soft drinks and recently acquired a major water bottling company in order to offer a broader product line. The acquisition will have a significant impact on Delite’s future results.You Fix It is a United States retail distributor of products for home improvement, primarily for those consumers who choose to do the work themselves. The home improvement industry is cyclical; the industry was adversely affected by the recent downturn in the economy, the level of foreclosures, and slow home sales. Although sales and earnings at You Fix It weakened, same store sales are beginning to improve as consumers undertake more home improvement projects. Poor performing stores were closed, resulting in significant restructuring charges in 2010.Before approving Cannan’s work, Ritter wants to discuss the calculations and choices of ratios used in the valuation of Delite and You Fix It. The data used by Cannan in his analysis is summarized in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Select Financial Data forD elite Beverage and You FixIt |
| Delite Beverage | You FixIt |
| 2010Eamingsper share(EPS) | $3.44 | $1.77 |
| 2011 estimated EPS | $3.50 | $1.99 |

| Free cashflow per share | $2.68 | $0.21 |
| Shares outstanding end of year | 2，322，034，000 | 1，638，821，000 |


Cannan advises Ritter that he is considering three different approaches to value the shares of You Fix It:● Approach 1Price-to-book (P/B) ratio● Approach 2Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio using trailing earnings● Approach 3Price-to-earnings ratio using normalized earningsCannan tells Ritter that he calculated the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) for You Fix It, but chose not to use it in the valuation of the shares. Cannan states to Ritter that it is more appropriate to use the P/E ratio rather than the P/S ratio because:● Reason 1Earnings are more stable than sales.● Reason 2Earnings are less easily manipulated than sales.● Reason 3The P/E ratio reflects financial leverage whereas the P/S ratio does not. Cannan also informs Ritter that he did not use a price-to-cash flow multiple in valuing the shares of Delite or You Fix It. The reason is that he could not identify a cash flow measure that would both account for working capital and non-cash revenues, and also be after interest expense and thus not be mismatched with share price.Ritter advises Cannan that such a cash flow measure does exist. Ritter provides Cannan with financial data on three close competitors as well as the overall beverage sector, which includes other competitors, in Exhibit 2. She asks Cannan to determine, based on the price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio, whether Delite shares are overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued.
| Exhibit 2.Beverage Sector Data |
| Forward P/E | Eam ings Growth |
| Delite |  | 12.41% |

| Non utter Soda | 15.64 | 11.94% |
| Tasty RootBeer | 44.10 | 20% |
| Beverage sector average | 16.40 | 10.80% |


After providing Ritter his answer, Cannan is concerned about the inclusion of Tasty Root Beer in the comparables analysis. Specifically, Cannan asks Ritter:“I feel we should mitigate the effect of large outliers, but not the impact of small outliers (i.e., those close to zero), when calculating the beverage sector P/E. What measure of central tendency would you suggest we use to address this concern?”Ritter requests that Cannan incorporate their discussion points before submitting the reports for final approval.

Pinho asks Flávia Silveira, a junior analyst, to complete an analysis of Adesivo S.A., Enviado S.A., and Gesticular S.A.Pinho directs Silveira to use a valuation metric that would allow for a meaningful ranking of relative value of the three companies’ shares. Exhibit 1 provides selected financial information for the three companies.
| Exhibit l.Selected Financial Information for Adesivo, Enviado, and Ges ticular |
| Adesivo | Enviado | Ges ticular |

| Diluted EPS(next four quarters) | 0.91 | 3.10 | 2.85 |
| Dividend rate(annualized most recent dividend) | 0.44 | 1.24 | 0.00 |


Silveira reviews underlying trailing EPS for Adesivo. Adesivo has basic trailing EPS of R$0.84. Silveira finds the following note in Adesivo’s financial statements:“On a per share basis, Adesivo incurred in the last four quartersi. from a lawsuit, a non-recurring gain of R$0.04; andii. from factory integration, a non-recurring cost of R$0.03 and a recurring cost of R$0.01 in increased depreciation.” Silveira notes that Adesivo is forecasted to pay semiannual dividends of R$0.24 next year.Silveira estimates five-year earnings growth rates for the three companies, which are presented in Exhibit 2.

| Company | Eam ings Growth Rate Estimate(%) |
| Adesivo | 16.67 |

Pinho asks Silveira about the possible use of the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) in assessing the relative value of the three companies. Silveira tells Pinho:● Statement 1The P/S is not affected by revenue recognition practices.● Statement 2The P/S is less subject to distortion from expense accounting than is the P/E. Pinho asks Silveira about using the Fed and Yardeni models to assess the value of the equity market. Silveira states:● Statement 3The Fed model concludes that the market is undervalued when the market’s current earnings yield is greater than the 10-year Treasury bond yield.● Statement 4The Yardeni model includes the consensus five-year earnings growth rate forecast for the market index. Silveira also analyzes the three companies using the enterprising value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple.Silveira notes that the EBITDA for Gesticular for the most recent year is R$560 million and gathers other selected information on Gesticular, which is presented in Exhibit 4.

Pinho asks Silveira about the use of momentum indicators in assessing the shares of the three companies. Silveira states:● Statement 5Relative-strength indicators compare an equity’s performance during a period with the performance of some group of equities or its own past performance.● Statement 6In the calculation of standardized unexpected earnings (SUE), the magnitude of unexpected earnings is typically scaled by the standard deviation of analysts’ earnings forecasts.
Based on Pinho’s directive and the data from the last four quarters presented in Exhibit 1, the valuation metric that Silveira should use is the:",price-to-earnings ratio (P/E).,production-to-demand ratio (P/D).,earnings-to-price ratio (E/P).,,C
42,"Alan Chin, the chief executive officer of Thunder Corporation, has asked his chief financial officer, Constance Ebinosa, to prepare a valuation of Thunder for the purpose of selling the company to a private investment partnership. Thunder is a profitable $200 million annual sales US domiciled manufacturer of generic household products. Customers consist of several grocery store chains in the United States. Competitors include large companies such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox, and Unilever. Thunder has been in business for 15 years and is privately owned by the original shareholders, none of whom are employed by the company. The company’s senior management has been in charge of the company’s operations for most of the past 15 years and expects to remain in that capacity after any sale.The partnership has expectations about Thunder similar to the current shareholders and management of Thunder. These investors expect to hold Thunder for an intermediate period of time and then bring the company public when market conditions are more favorable than currently.Chin is concerned about what definition of value should be used when analyzing Thunder. He notes that the stock market has been very volatile recently. He also wonders whether fair market value can be realistically estimated when the most similar recent private market transactions may not have been at arm’s length.Chin asks Ebinosa whether there will be differences in the process of valuing a private company like Thunder compared with a public company. Ebinosa replies that differences do exist and mentions several factors an analyst must consider.Ebinosa also explains that several approaches are available for valuing private companies. She mentions that one possibility is to use an asset-based approach because Thunder has a relatively large and efficient factory and warehouse for its products. A real estate appraiser can readily determine the value of these facilities. A second method would be the market approach and using an average of the price-to-earnings multiples for Procter & Gamble and Clorox. A third possibility is a discounted free cash flow approach. The latter would focus on a continuation of Thunder’s trend of slow profitable growth during the past ten years.The private investment partnership has mentioned that they are likely to use an income approach as one of their methods. Ebinosa decides to validate the estimates they make. She assumes for the next 12 months that Thunder’s revenues increase by the long-term annual growth rate of 3 percent. She also makes the following assumptions to calculate the free cash flow to the firm for the next 12 months:● Gross profit margin is 45 percent. ? Depreciation is 2 percent of revenues.● Selling, general, and administrative expenses are 24 percent of revenues.● Capital expenditures equal 125 percent of depreciation to support the current level of revenues.● Additional capital expenditures of 15 percent of incremental revenues are needed to fund future growth.● Working capital investment equals 8 percent of incremental revenues.● Marginal tax rate on EBIT is 35 percent.Chin knows that if an income approach is used then the choice of discount rate may have a large influence on the estimated value. He makes two statements regarding discount rate estimates:1. If the CAPM method is used to estimate the discount rate with a beta estimate based on public companies with operations and revenues similar to Thunder, then a small stock premium should be added to the estimate.2. The weighted average cost of capital of the private investment partnership should be used to value Thunder.Ebinosa decides to calculate a value of Thunder’s equity using the capitalized cash flow method (CCM) and decides to use the build-up method to estimate Thunder’s required return on equity. She makes the following assumptions:● Growth of FCFE is at a constant annual rate of 3 percent.● Free cash flow to equity for the year ahead is $2.5 million.● Risk free rate is 4.5 percent.● Equity risk premium is 5.0 percent.● Size premium is 2.0 percent.
Ebinosa can best value Thunder using the:",excess earnings approach.,asset-based approach.,discounted free cash flow approach.,,C

Izzo’s team first discusses key characteristics of Company A. The company has a history of paying modest dividends relative to FCFE, has a stable capital structure, and is owned by a controlling investor.The team also considers the impact of Company A’s three non-cash transactions in the most recent year on its FCFE, including the following:● Transaction 1: A $900 million loss on a sale of equipment● Transaction 2: An impairment of intangibles of $400 million● Transaction 3: A $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring chargeIn addition, Company A’s annual report indicates that the firm expects to incur additional non-cash charges related to restructuring over the next few years.To value the three companies’ shares, one team member suggests valuing the companies’ shares using net income as a proxy for FCFE. Another team member proposes forecasting FCFE using a sales-based methodology based on the following equation:FCFE = NI – (1 – DR)(FCInv – Dep) – (1 – DR)(WCInv)Izzo’s team ultimately decides to use actual free cash flow to value the three companies’ shares.

44,"Alan Chin, the chief executive officer of Thunder Corporation, has asked his chief financial officer, Constance Ebinosa, to prepare a valuation of Thunder for the purpose of selling the company to a private investment partnership. Thunder is a profitable $200 million annual sales US domiciled manufacturer of generic household products. Customers consist of several grocery store chains in the United States. Competitors include large companies such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox, and Unilever. Thunder has been in business for 15 years and is privately owned by the original shareholders, none of whom are employed by the company. The company’s senior management has been in charge of the company’s operations for most of the past 15 years and expects to remain in that capacity after any sale.The partnership has expectations about Thunder similar to the current shareholders and management of Thunder. These investors expect to hold Thunder for an intermediate period of time and then bring the company public when market conditions are more favorable than currently.Chin is concerned about what definition of value should be used when analyzing Thunder. He notes that the stock market has been very volatile recently. He also wonders whether fair market value can be realistically estimated when the most similar recent private market transactions may not have been at arm’s length.Chin asks Ebinosa whether there will be differences in the process of valuing a private company like Thunder compared with a public company. Ebinosa replies that differences do exist and mentions several factors an analyst must consider.Ebinosa also explains that several approaches are available for valuing private companies. She mentions that one possibility is to use an asset-based approach because Thunder has a relatively large and efficient factory and warehouse for its products. A real estate appraiser can readily determine the value of these facilities. A second method would be the market approach and using an average of the price-to-earnings multiples for Procter & Gamble and Clorox. A third possibility is a discounted free cash flow approach. The latter would focus on a continuation of Thunder’s trend of slow profitable growth during the past ten years.The private investment partnership has mentioned that they are likely to use an income approach as one of their methods. Ebinosa decides to validate the estimates they make. She assumes for the next 12 months that Thunder’s revenues increase by the long-term annual growth rate of 3 percent. She also makes the following assumptions to calculate the free cash flow to the firm for the next 12 months:● Gross profit margin is 45 percent. ? Depreciation is 2 percent of revenues.● Selling, general, and administrative expenses are 24 percent of revenues.● Capital expenditures equal 125 percent of depreciation to support the current level of revenues.● Additional capital expenditures of 15 percent of incremental revenues are needed to fund future growth.● Working capital investment equals 8 percent of incremental revenues.● Marginal tax rate on EBIT is 35 percent.Chin knows that if an income approach is used then the choice of discount rate may have a large influence on the estimated value. He makes two statements regarding discount rate estimates:1. If the CAPM method is used to estimate the discount rate with a beta estimate based on public companies with operations and revenues similar to Thunder, then a small stock premium should be added to the estimate.2. The weighted average cost of capital of the private investment partnership should be used to value Thunder.Ebinosa decides to calculate a value of Thunder’s equity using the capitalized cash flow method (CCM) and decides to use the build-up method to estimate Thunder’s required return on equity. She makes the following assumptions:● Growth of FCFE is at a constant annual rate of 3 percent.● Free cash flow to equity for the year ahead is $2.5 million.● Risk free rate is 4.5 percent.● Equity risk premium is 5.0 percent.● Size premium is 2.0 percent.
The least likely factor that would be a source of differences in valuing Thunder compared with valuing a publicly traded company is:",access to public debt markets.,agency problems.,the size of the company.,,B

47,"Nigel French, an analyst at Taurus Investment Management, is analyzing Archway Technologies, a manufacturer of luxury electronic auto equipment, at the request of his supervisor, Lukas Wright. French is asked to evaluate Archway’s profitability over the past five years relative to its two main competitors, which are located in different countries with significantly different tax structures.French begins by assessing Archway’s competitive position within the luxury electronic auto equipment industry using Porter’s five forces framework. A summary of French’s industry analysis is presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit-l…Analysis of-Luxury Electronic-Auto Equipment-Industry Using Porter's |
| Force | Factors to Consider |
| Threat of substitutes | Customer switching costs are high |
| Rivalry | Archway holds 60%of world market-share； each of its two main |

| suppliers | large number of suppliers |
| Bargaining power of Luxury electronic-auto-equipment-is-very-specialized-(non- |
| buyers | standardized) |
| Threat of new entrants | High-fixed costs to enter industry |


French notes that for the year just ended (2019), Archway’s cost of goods sold was 30% of sales. To forecast Archway’s income statement for 2020, French assumes that all companies in the industry will experience an inflation rate of 8% on the cost of goods sold. Exhibit 2 shows French’s forecasts relating to Archway’s price and volume changes.
| Exhibit 2.Archway's 2020-Forecasted-Price and Volume Changes |
| Average price increase per unit5.00%Volume growth-3.00% |


After putting together income statement projections for Archway, French forecasts Archway’s balance sheet items; He uses Archway’s historical efficiency ratios to forecast the company’s working capital accounts.Based on his financial forecast for Archway, French estimates a terminal value using a valuation multiple based on the company’s average price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) over the past five years. Wright discusses with French how the terminal value estimate is sensitive to key assumptions about the company’s future prospects. Wright asks French:“What change in the calculation of the terminal value would you make if a technological development that would adversely affect Archway was forecast to occur sometime beyond your financial forecast horizon?”
Based on Exhibit 2, Archway’s forecasted gross profit margin for 2020 is closest to:",62.7%.,67.0%.,69.1%.,,C

51,"Assorted Fund, a UK-based globally diversified equity mutual fund, is considering adding Talisman Energy Inc. (Toronto Stock Exchange: TLM) to its portfolio. Talisman is an independent upstream oil and gas company headquartered in Calgary, Canada. It is one of the largest oil and gas companies in Canada and has operations in several countries. Brian Dobson, an analyst at the mutual fund, has been assigned the task of estimating a fair value of Talisman. Dobson is aware of several approaches that could be used for this purpose. After carefully considering the characteristics of the company and its competitors, he believes the company will have extraordinary growth for the next few years and normal growth thereafter. So, he has concluded that a two-stage DDM is the most appropriate for valuing the stock.Talisman pays semi-annual dividends. The total dividends during 2006, 2007, and 2008 have been C$0.114, C$0.15, and C$0.175, respectively. These imply a growth rate of 32 percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2008. Dobson believes that the growth rate will be 14 percent in the next year. He has estimated that the first stage will include the next eight years.Dobson is using the CAPM to estimate the required return on equity for Talisman. He has estimated that the beta of Talisman, as measured against the S&P/TSX Composite Index (formerly TSE 300 Composite Index), is 0.84. The Canadian risk-free rate, as measured by the annual yield on the 10-year government bond, is 4.1 percent. The equity risk premium for the Canadian market is estimated at 5.5 percent. Based on these data, Dobson has estimated that the required return on Talisman stock is 0.041 + 0.84(0.055) = 0.0872 or 8.72 percent. Dobson is doing the analysis in January 2009 and the stock price at that time is C$17.Dobson realizes that even within the two-stage DDM, there could be some variations in the approach. He would like to explore how these variations affect the valuation of the stock. Specifically, he wants to estimate the value of the stock for each of the following approaches separately.I. The dividend growth rate will be 14 percent throughout the first stage of eight years. The dividend growth rate thereafter will be 7 percent.II. Instead of using the estimated stable growth rate of 7 percent in the second stage, Dobson wants to use his estimate that eight years later Talisman’s stock will be worth 17 times its earnings per share (trailing P/E of 17). He expects that the earnings retention ratio at that time will be 0.70.III. In contrast to the first approach above in which the growth rate declines abruptly from 14 percent in the eighth year to 7 percent in the ninth, the growth rate would decline linearly from 14 percent in the first year to 7 percent in the ninth.
Based on the third approach (the H-model), the stock is:",undervalued.,fairly valued.,overvalued.,,C

Pinho asks Silveira about the possible use of the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) in assessing the relative value of the three companies. Silveira tells Pinho:● Statement 1The P/S is not affected by revenue recognition practices.● Statement 2The P/S is less subject to distortion from expense accounting than is the P/E. Pinho asks Silveira about using the Fed and Yardeni models to assess the value of the equity market. Silveira states:● Statement 3The Fed model concludes that the market is undervalued when the market’s current earnings yield is greater than the 10-year Treasury bond yield.● Statement 4The Yardeni model includes the consensus five-year earnings growth rate forecast for the market index. Silveira also analyzes the three companies using the enterprising value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple.Silveira notes that the EBITDA for Gesticular for the most recent year is R$560 million and gathers other selected information on Gesticular, which is presented in Exhibit 4.

53,"Elena Castovan is a junior analyst with Contralith Capital, a long-only equity investment manager. She has been asked to value three stocks on Contralith's watch list: Portous, Inc. (PTU), SSX Financial (SSX), and Tantechi Ltd. (TTCI).During their weekly meeting, Castovan and her supervisor, Ariana Beckworth, discuss characteristics of residual income (RI) models. Castovan tells Beckworth the following.Statement 1 The present value of the terminal value in RI models is often a larger portion of the total intrinsic value than it is in other DCF valuation models.Statement 2 The RI model's use of accounting income assumes that the cost of debt capital is appropriately reflected by interest expense.Statement 3 RI models cannot be readily applied to companies that do not have positive expected near-term free cash flows.Beckworth asks Castovan why an RI model may be more appropriate for valuing PTU than the dividend discount model or a free cash flow model. Castovan tells Beckworth that, over her five-year forecast horizon, she expects PTU to perform the following actions.Reason 1 Pay dividends that are unpredictableReason 2 Generate positive and fairly predictable free cash flowsReason 3 Report significant amounts of other comprehensive incomeAt the conclusion of their meeting, Beckworth asks Castovan to value SSX using RI models.

For the multistage model, Castovan forecasts TTCI's ROE to be higher than its long-term ROE for the first three years. Forecasted earnings per share and dividends per share for TTCI are presented in Exhibit 3. Starting in Year 4, Castovan forecasts TTCI's ROE to revert to the constant long-term ROE of 12% annually. The terminal value is based on an assumption that residual income per share will be constant from Year 3 into perpetuity.

54,"Mark Cannan is updating research reports on two well-established consumer companies before first quarter 2011 earnings reports are released. His supervisor, Sharolyn Ritter, has asked Cannan to use market-based valuations when updating the reports.Delite Beverage is a manufacturer and distributor of soft drinks and recently acquired a major water bottling company in order to offer a broader product line. The acquisition will have a significant impact on Delite’s future results.You Fix It is a United States retail distributor of products for home improvement, primarily for those consumers who choose to do the work themselves. The home improvement industry is cyclical; the industry was adversely affected by the recent downturn in the economy, the level of foreclosures, and slow home sales. Although sales and earnings at You Fix It weakened, same store sales are beginning to improve as consumers undertake more home improvement projects. Poor performing stores were closed, resulting in significant restructuring charges in 2010.Before approving Cannan’s work, Ritter wants to discuss the calculations and choices of ratios used in the valuation of Delite and You Fix It. The data used by Cannan in his analysis is summarized in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Select Financial Data forD elite Beverage and You FixIt |
| Delite Beverage | You FixIt |
| 2010Eamingsper share(EPS) | $3.44 | $1.77 |
| 2011 estimated EPS | $3.50 | $1.99 |
| Book value per share end of year | $62.05 | $11.64 |
| Current share price | $65.50 | $37.23 |

| Free cashflow per share | $2.68 | $0.21 |
| Shares outstanding end of year | 2，322，034，000 | 1，638，821，000 |


Cannan advises Ritter that he is considering three different approaches to value the shares of You Fix It:● Approach 1Price-to-book (P/B) ratio● Approach 2Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio using trailing earnings● Approach 3Price-to-earnings ratio using normalized earningsCannan tells Ritter that he calculated the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) for You Fix It, but chose not to use it in the valuation of the shares. Cannan states to Ritter that it is more appropriate to use the P/E ratio rather than the P/S ratio because:● Reason 1Earnings are more stable than sales.● Reason 2Earnings are less easily manipulated than sales.● Reason 3The P/E ratio reflects financial leverage whereas the P/S ratio does not. Cannan also informs Ritter that he did not use a price-to-cash flow multiple in valuing the shares of Delite or You Fix It. The reason is that he could not identify a cash flow measure that would both account for working capital and non-cash revenues, and also be after interest expense and thus not be mismatched with share price.Ritter advises Cannan that such a cash flow measure does exist. Ritter provides Cannan with financial data on three close competitors as well as the overall beverage sector, which includes other competitors, in Exhibit 2. She asks Cannan to determine, based on the price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio, whether Delite shares are overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued.
| Exhibit 2.Beverage Sector Data |
| Forward P/E | Eam ings Growth |
| Delite |  | 12.41% |
| Fresh Iced Tea Company | 16.59 | 9.52% |
| Non utter Soda | 15.64 | 11.94% |
| Tasty RootBeer | 44.10 | 20% |
| Beverage sector average | 16.40 | 10.80% |


After providing Ritter his answer, Cannan is concerned about the inclusion of Tasty Root Beer in the comparables analysis. Specifically, Cannan asks Ritter:“I feel we should mitigate the effect of large outliers, but not the impact of small outliers (i.e., those close to zero), when calculating the beverage sector P/E. What measure of central tendency would you suggest we use to address this concern?”Ritter requests that Cannan incorporate their discussion points before submitting the reports for final approval.
Based upon the information in Exhibit 1, the price-to-sales ratio for You Fix It is closest to:",0.28.,0.55.,0.90.,,C
55,"Elena Castovan is a junior analyst with Contralith Capital, a long-only equity investment manager. She has been asked to value three stocks on Contralith's watch list: Portous, Inc. (PTU), SSX Financial (SSX), and Tantechi Ltd. (TTCI).During their weekly meeting, Castovan and her supervisor, Ariana Beckworth, discuss characteristics of residual income (RI) models. Castovan tells Beckworth the following.Statement 1 The present value of the terminal value in RI models is often a larger portion of the total intrinsic value than it is in other DCF valuation models.Statement 2 The RI model's use of accounting income assumes that the cost of debt capital is appropriately reflected by interest expense.Statement 3 RI models cannot be readily applied to companies that do not have positive expected near-term free cash flows.Beckworth asks Castovan why an RI model may be more appropriate for valuing PTU than the dividend discount model or a free cash flow model. Castovan tells Beckworth that, over her five-year forecast horizon, she expects PTU to perform the following actions.Reason 1 Pay dividends that are unpredictableReason 2 Generate positive and fairly predictable free cash flowsReason 3 Report significant amounts of other comprehensive incomeAt the conclusion of their meeting, Beckworth asks Castovan to value SSX using RI models.

56,"Alan Chin, the chief executive officer of Thunder Corporation, has asked his chief financial officer, Constance Ebinosa, to prepare a valuation of Thunder for the purpose of selling the company to a private investment partnership. Thunder is a profitable $200 million annual sales US domiciled manufacturer of generic household products. Customers consist of several grocery store chains in the United States. Competitors include large companies such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox, and Unilever. Thunder has been in business for 15 years and is privately owned by the original shareholders, none of whom are employed by the company. The company’s senior management has been in charge of the company’s operations for most of the past 15 years and expects to remain in that capacity after any sale.The partnership has expectations about Thunder similar to the current shareholders and management of Thunder. These investors expect to hold Thunder for an intermediate period of time and then bring the company public when market conditions are more favorable than currently.Chin is concerned about what definition of value should be used when analyzing Thunder. He notes that the stock market has been very volatile recently. He also wonders whether fair market value can be realistically estimated when the most similar recent private market transactions may not have been at arm’s length.Chin asks Ebinosa whether there will be differences in the process of valuing a private company like Thunder compared with a public company. Ebinosa replies that differences do exist and mentions several factors an analyst must consider.Ebinosa also explains that several approaches are available for valuing private companies. She mentions that one possibility is to use an asset-based approach because Thunder has a relatively large and efficient factory and warehouse for its products. A real estate appraiser can readily determine the value of these facilities. A second method would be the market approach and using an average of the price-to-earnings multiples for Procter & Gamble and Clorox. A third possibility is a discounted free cash flow approach. The latter would focus on a continuation of Thunder’s trend of slow profitable growth during the past ten years.The private investment partnership has mentioned that they are likely to use an income approach as one of their methods. Ebinosa decides to validate the estimates they make. She assumes for the next 12 months that Thunder’s revenues increase by the long-term annual growth rate of 3 percent. She also makes the following assumptions to calculate the free cash flow to the firm for the next 12 months:● Gross profit margin is 45 percent. ? Depreciation is 2 percent of revenues.● Selling, general, and administrative expenses are 24 percent of revenues.● Capital expenditures equal 125 percent of depreciation to support the current level of revenues.● Additional capital expenditures of 15 percent of incremental revenues are needed to fund future growth.● Working capital investment equals 8 percent of incremental revenues.● Marginal tax rate on EBIT is 35 percent.Chin knows that if an income approach is used then the choice of discount rate may have a large influence on the estimated value. He makes two statements regarding discount rate estimates:1. If the CAPM method is used to estimate the discount rate with a beta estimate based on public companies with operations and revenues similar to Thunder, then a small stock premium should be added to the estimate.2. The weighted average cost of capital of the private investment partnership should be used to value Thunder.Ebinosa decides to calculate a value of Thunder’s equity using the capitalized cash flow method (CCM) and decides to use the build-up method to estimate Thunder’s required return on equity. She makes the following assumptions:● Growth of FCFE is at a constant annual rate of 3 percent.● Free cash flow to equity for the year ahead is $2.5 million.● Risk free rate is 4.5 percent.● Equity risk premium is 5.0 percent.● Size premium is 2.0 percent.

57,"Assorted Fund, a UK-based globally diversified equity mutual fund, is considering adding Talisman Energy Inc. (Toronto Stock Exchange: TLM) to its portfolio. Talisman is an independent upstream oil and gas company headquartered in Calgary, Canada. It is one of the largest oil and gas companies in Canada and has operations in several countries. Brian Dobson, an analyst at the mutual fund, has been assigned the task of estimating a fair value of Talisman. Dobson is aware of several approaches that could be used for this purpose. After carefully considering the characteristics of the company and its competitors, he believes the company will have extraordinary growth for the next few years and normal growth thereafter. So, he has concluded that a two-stage DDM is the most appropriate for valuing the stock.Talisman pays semi-annual dividends. The total dividends during 2006, 2007, and 2008 have been C$0.114, C$0.15, and C$0.175, respectively. These imply a growth rate of 32 percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2008. Dobson believes that the growth rate will be 14 percent in the next year. He has estimated that the first stage will include the next eight years.Dobson is using the CAPM to estimate the required return on equity for Talisman. He has estimated that the beta of Talisman, as measured against the S&P/TSX Composite Index (formerly TSE 300 Composite Index), is 0.84. The Canadian risk-free rate, as measured by the annual yield on the 10-year government bond, is 4.1 percent. The equity risk premium for the Canadian market is estimated at 5.5 percent. Based on these data, Dobson has estimated that the required return on Talisman stock is 0.041 + 0.84(0.055) = 0.0872 or 8.72 percent. Dobson is doing the analysis in January 2009 and the stock price at that time is C$17.Dobson realizes that even within the two-stage DDM, there could be some variations in the approach. He would like to explore how these variations affect the valuation of the stock. Specifically, he wants to estimate the value of the stock for each of the following approaches separately.I. The dividend growth rate will be 14 percent throughout the first stage of eight years. The dividend growth rate thereafter will be 7 percent.II. Instead of using the estimated stable growth rate of 7 percent in the second stage, Dobson wants to use his estimate that eight years later Talisman’s stock will be worth 17 times its earnings per share (trailing P/E of 17). He expects that the earnings retention ratio at that time will be 0.70.III. In contrast to the first approach above in which the growth rate declines abruptly from 14 percent in the eighth year to 7 percent in the ninth, the growth rate would decline linearly from 14 percent in the first year to 7 percent in the ninth.

Silveira reviews underlying trailing EPS for Adesivo. Adesivo has basic trailing EPS of R$0.84. Silveira finds the following note in Adesivo’s financial statements:“On a per share basis, Adesivo incurred in the last four quartersi. from a lawsuit, a non-recurring gain of R$0.04; andii. from factory integration, a non-recurring cost of R$0.03 and a recurring cost of R$0.01 in increased depreciation.” Silveira notes that Adesivo is forecasted to pay semiannual dividends of R$0.24 next year.Silveira estimates five-year earnings growth rates for the three companies, which are presented in Exhibit 2.

Pinho asks Silveira about the possible use of the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) in assessing the relative value of the three companies. Silveira tells Pinho:● Statement 1The P/S is not affected by revenue recognition practices.● Statement 2The P/S is less subject to distortion from expense accounting than is the P/E. Pinho asks Silveira about using the Fed and Yardeni models to assess the value of the equity market. Silveira states:● Statement 3The Fed model concludes that the market is undervalued when the market’s current earnings yield is greater than the 10-year Treasury bond yield.● Statement 4The Yardeni model includes the consensus five-year earnings growth rate forecast for the market index. Silveira also analyzes the three companies using the enterprising value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple.Silveira notes that the EBITDA for Gesticular for the most recent year is R$560 million and gathers other selected information on Gesticular, which is presented in Exhibit 4.

Izzo’s team first discusses key characteristics of Company A. The company has a history of paying modest dividends relative to FCFE, has a stable capital structure, and is owned by a controlling investor.The team also considers the impact of Company A’s three non-cash transactions in the most recent year on its FCFE, including the following:● Transaction 1: A $900 million loss on a sale of equipment● Transaction 2: An impairment of intangibles of $400 million● Transaction 3: A $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring chargeIn addition, Company A’s annual report indicates that the firm expects to incur additional non-cash charges related to restructuring over the next few years.To value the three companies’ shares, one team member suggests valuing the companies’ shares using net income as a proxy for FCFE. Another team member proposes forecasting FCFE using a sales-based methodology based on the following equation:FCFE = NI – (1 – DR)(FCInv – Dep) – (1 – DR)(WCInv)Izzo’s team ultimately decides to use actual free cash flow to value the three companies’ shares.

Kwaza asks Khan to investigate the most appropriate models for valuing utility companies. She tells Khan about the following points mentioned in various research reports on the utilities sector.● Report 1: A resurgence in domestic manufacturing activity will generate longterm growth in earnings and dividends that exceeds the cost of equity.● Report 2: Share repurchases are expected to increase. The report expresses confidence in the forecasts regarding the magnitude and timing of these repurchases.● Report 3: The report forecasts earnings growth of 4.5%. The key growth drivers are increases in population and business creation associated with stable GDP growth of 2.75%.For Client 2's portfolio, Khan has identified the non-callable perpetual preferred stocks of Standard Company and Main Company.● The Standard Company's preferred stock pays 2.75% on a par value of $100. Khan believes it to be fairly valued at a market price of $49.60.● The perpetual preferred stock of Main Company has a par value of $50 per share and pays an annual dividend of 5.5%. Khan estimates a capitalization rate at 6%. The current market price of Main Company preferred stock is $42.Finally, Khan has identified three stocks, shown in Exhibit 2, as likely candidates for Client 3's portfolio.

He has developed a stock valuation model for this firm based on its forecasted fundamentals. His revenue growth rate estimate is less than that implied by the market price.Phoneutria’s financial statements over the past five years show strong performance, with above average growth. Santos has decided to use a lower forecasted growth rate in his models, reflecting the effect of “regression to the mean” over time. He notes two reasons for his lower growth rate forecast:Reason 1 Successful companies tend to draw more competition, putting their high profits under pressure.Reason 2 Phoneutria’s intellectual property and franchise agreements will be weakening over time.Santos meets with Walter Hartmann, a newly hired associate in his department. In their conversation, Hartmann states, “Security analysts forecast company performance using both top-down and bottom-up analysis. I can think of three examples:1 A restaurant chain forecasts its sales to be its market share times forecast industry sales.2 An electric utility company forecasts that its sales will grow proportional to increases in GDP.3 A retail furniture company forecasts next year’s sales by assuming that the sales in its newly built stores will have similar sales per square meter to that of its existing stores.”Hartmann is reviewing some possible trades for three stocks in the health care industry based on a pairs-trading strategy.

Leigh presents his valuations of the common stock of Emerald and Holt to his supervisor, Alice Smith. Smith has the following questions and comments:1 “I estimate that Emerald’s long-term expected dividend payout rate is 20% and its return on equity is 10% over the long term.”2 “Why did you use an FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock? Can you use a DDM instead?”3 “How did Holt’s FCFE for 2020 compare with its FCFF for the same year? I recommend you use an FCFF model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using an FCFE model because Holt has had a history of leverage changes in the past.”4 “In the last three years, about 5% of Holt’s growth in FCFE has come from decreases in inventory.”Leigh responds to each of Smith’s points as follows:1 “I will use your estimates and calculate Emerald’s long-term, sustainable dividend growth rate.”2 “There are two reasons why I used the FCFE model to value Holt’s common stock instead of using a DDM. The first reason is that Holt’s dividends have differed significantly from its capacity to pay dividends. The second reason is that Holt is a takeover target and once the company is taken over, the new owners will have discretion over the uses of free cash flow.”3 “I will calculate Holt’s FCFF for 2020 and estimate the value of Holt’s common stock using an FCFF model.”4 “Holt is a growing company. In forecasting either Holt’s FCFE or FCFF growth rates, I will not consider decreases in inventory to be a long-term source of growth.”
Smith's recommendation to use a FCFF model to value Holt is:","logical, given the prospect of Holt changing capital structure.",not logical because a FCFF model is used only to value the total firm.,not logical because FCFE represents a more direct approach to free cash flow valuation.,,A
63,"Nigel French, an analyst at Taurus Investment Management, is analyzing Archway Technologies, a manufacturer of luxury electronic auto equipment, at the request of his supervisor, Lukas Wright. French is asked to evaluate Archway’s profitability over the past five years relative to its two main competitors, which are located in different countries with significantly different tax structures.French begins by assessing Archway’s competitive position within the luxury electronic auto equipment industry using Porter’s five forces framework. A summary of French’s industry analysis is presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit-l…Analysis of-Luxury Electronic-Auto Equipment-Industry Using Porter's |
| Force | Factors to Consider |
| Threat of substitutes | Customer switching costs are high |
| Rivalry | Archway holds 60%of world market-share； each of its two main |
| competitors holds 15% |
| Bargaining power of | Primary inputs are considered basic commodities， and there area |
| suppliers | large number of suppliers |
| Bargaining power of Luxury electronic-auto-equipment-is-very-specialized-(non- |
| buyers | standardized) |
| Threat of new entrants | High-fixed costs to enter industry |


French notes that for the year just ended (2019), Archway’s cost of goods sold was 30% of sales. To forecast Archway’s income statement for 2020, French assumes that all companies in the industry will experience an inflation rate of 8% on the cost of goods sold. Exhibit 2 shows French’s forecasts relating to Archway’s price and volume changes.

After putting together income statement projections for Archway, French forecasts Archway’s balance sheet items; He uses Archway’s historical efficiency ratios to forecast the company’s working capital accounts.Based on his financial forecast for Archway, French estimates a terminal value using a valuation multiple based on the company’s average price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) over the past five years. Wright discusses with French how the terminal value estimate is sensitive to key assumptions about the company’s future prospects. Wright asks French:“What change in the calculation of the terminal value would you make if a technological development that would adversely affect Archway was forecast to occur sometime beyond your financial forecast horizon?”
The most appropriate response to Wright’s question about the technological development is to:",increase the required return.,decrease the price-to-earnings multiple.,decrease the perpetual growth rate.,,B
64,"Guardian Capital is a rapidly growing US investment firm. The Guardian Capital research team is responsible for identifying undervalued and overvalued publicly traded equities that have a market capitalization greater than $500 million.Due to the rapid growth of assets under management, Guardian Capital recently hired a new analyst, Jack Richardson, to support the research process. At the new analyst orientation meeting, the director of research made the following statements about equity valuation at Guardian:Statement 1“Analysts at Guardian Capital seek to identify mispricing, relying on price eventually converging to intrinsic value. However, convergence of the market price to an analyst’s estimate of intrinsic value may not happen within the portfolio manager’s investment time horizon. So, besides evidence of mispricing, analysts should look for the presence of a particular market or corporate event,—that is, a catalyst— that will cause the marketplace to re-evaluate the subject firm’s prospects.”Statement 2“An active investment manager attempts to capture positive alpha. But mispricing of assets is not directly observable. It is therefore important that you understand the possible sources of perceived mispricing.”Statement 3“For its distressed securities fund, Guardian Capital screens its investable universe of securities for companies in financial distress.”Statement 4“For its core equity fund, Guardian Capital selects financially sound companies that are expected to generate significant positive free cash flow from core business operations within a multiyear forecast horizon.”Statement 5“Guardian Capital’s research process requires analysts to evaluate the reasonableness of the expectations implied by the market price by comparing the market’s implied expectations to his or her own expectations.”After the orientation meeting, the director of research asks Richardson to evaluate three companies that are retailers of men’s clothing: Diamond Co., Renaissance Clothing, and Deluxe Men’s Wear.Richardson starts his analysis by evaluating the characteristics of the men’s retail clothing industry. He finds few barriers to new retail entrants, high intra-industry rivalry among retailers, low product substitution costs for customers and a large number of wholesale clothing suppliers.While conducting his analysis, Richardson discovers that Renaissance Clothing included three non-recurring items in their most recent earnings release: a positive litigation settlement, a one-time tax credit, and the gain on the sale of a non-operating asset.To estimate each firm’s intrinsic value, Richardson applies appropriate discount rates to each firm’s estimated free cash flows over a ten-year time horizon and to the estimated value of the firm at the end of the ten-year horizon.Michelle Lee, a junior technology analyst at Guardian, asks the director of research for advice as to which valuation model to use for VEGA, a fast growing semiconductor company that is rapidly gaining market share.The director of research states that “the valuation model selected must be consistent with the characteristics of the company being valued.”Lee tells the director of research that VEGA is not expected to be profitable for several more years. According to management guidance, when the company turns profitable, it will invest in new product development; as a result, it does not expect to initiate a dividend for an extended period of time. Lee also notes that she expects that certain larger competitors will become interested in acquiring VEGA because of its excellent growth prospects. The director of research advises Lee to consider that in her valuation.
With respect to Statement 4, which measure of value is most relevant for the analyst of the fund described?",Liquidation value,Investment value,Going-concern value,,C
65,"Ryan Leigh is preparing a presentation that analyzes the valuation of the common stock of two companies under consideration as additions to his firm’s recommended list, Emerald Corporation and Holt Corporation. Leigh has prepared preliminary valuations of both companies using an FCFE model and is also preparing a value estimate for Emerald using a dividend discount model. Holt’s 2019 and 2020 financial statements, contained in Exhibits 1 and 2, are prepared in accordance with US GAAP.

Izzo’s team first discusses key characteristics of Company A. The company has a history of paying modest dividends relative to FCFE, has a stable capital structure, and is owned by a controlling investor.The team also considers the impact of Company A’s three non-cash transactions in the most recent year on its FCFE, including the following:● Transaction 1: A $900 million loss on a sale of equipment● Transaction 2: An impairment of intangibles of $400 million● Transaction 3: A $300 million reversal of a previously recorded restructuring chargeIn addition, Company A’s annual report indicates that the firm expects to incur additional non-cash charges related to restructuring over the next few years.To value the three companies’ shares, one team member suggests valuing the companies’ shares using net income as a proxy for FCFE. Another team member proposes forecasting FCFE using a sales-based methodology based on the following equation:FCFE = NI – (1 – DR)(FCInv – Dep) – (1 – DR)(WCInv)Izzo’s team ultimately decides to use actual free cash flow to value the three companies’ shares. Selected data and assumptions are provided in Exhibit 2.

| Before-tax cost of debt | 6% | 7% | 6% |
| Target debt ratio | 50% | 30% | 40% |


Market data:Risk-free rate: 3%Market risk premium: 7%The team calculates the intrinsic value of Company B using a two-stage FCFE model. FCFE growth rates for the first four years are estimated at 10%, 9%, 8%, and 7%, respectively, before declining to a constant 6% starting in the fifth year.To calculate the intrinsic value of Company C’s equity, the team uses the FCFF approach assuming a single-stage model where FCFF is expected to grow at 5% indefinitely.
Based on Exhibits 1 and 2 and the proposed single-stage FCFF model, the intrinsic value of Company C’s equity is closest to:","$277,907 million.","$295,876 million.","$306,595 million.",,C
67,"Assorted Fund, a UK-based globally diversified equity mutual fund, is considering adding Talisman Energy Inc. (Toronto Stock Exchange: TLM) to its portfolio. Talisman is an independent upstream oil and gas company headquartered in Calgary, Canada. It is one of the largest oil and gas companies in Canada and has operations in several countries. Brian Dobson, an analyst at the mutual fund, has been assigned the task of estimating a fair value of Talisman. Dobson is aware of several approaches that could be used for this purpose. After carefully considering the characteristics of the company and its competitors, he believes the company will have extraordinary growth for the next few years and normal growth thereafter. So, he has concluded that a two-stage DDM is the most appropriate for valuing the stock.Talisman pays semi-annual dividends. The total dividends during 2006, 2007, and 2008 have been C$0.114, C$0.15, and C$0.175, respectively. These imply a growth rate of 32 percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2008. Dobson believes that the growth rate will be 14 percent in the next year. He has estimated that the first stage will include the next eight years.Dobson is using the CAPM to estimate the required return on equity for Talisman. He has estimated that the beta of Talisman, as measured against the S&P/TSX Composite Index (formerly TSE 300 Composite Index), is 0.84. The Canadian risk-free rate, as measured by the annual yield on the 10-year government bond, is 4.1 percent. The equity risk premium for the Canadian market is estimated at 5.5 percent. Based on these data, Dobson has estimated that the required return on Talisman stock is 0.041 + 0.84(0.055) = 0.0872 or 8.72 percent. Dobson is doing the analysis in January 2009 and the stock price at that time is C$17.Dobson realizes that even within the two-stage DDM, there could be some variations in the approach. He would like to explore how these variations affect the valuation of the stock. Specifically, he wants to estimate the value of the stock for each of the following approaches separately.I. The dividend growth rate will be 14 percent throughout the first stage of eight years. The dividend growth rate thereafter will be 7 percent.II. Instead of using the estimated stable growth rate of 7 percent in the second stage, Dobson wants to use his estimate that eight years later Talisman’s stock will be worth 17 times its earnings per share (trailing P/E of 17). He expects that the earnings retention ratio at that time will be 0.70.III. In contrast to the first approach above in which the growth rate declines abruptly from 14 percent in the eighth year to 7 percent in the ninth, the growth rate would decline linearly from 14 percent in the first year to 7 percent in the ninth.
Dobson is wondering what the consequences would be if the duration of the first stage was assumed to be 11 years instead of 8, with all the other assumptions/estimates remaining the same. Considering this change, which of the following is true?","In the second approach, the proportion of the total value of the stock represented by the second stage would not change.",The total value estimated using the third approach would increase.,Using this new assumption and the first approach will lead Dobson to conclude that the stock is overvalued.,,B
