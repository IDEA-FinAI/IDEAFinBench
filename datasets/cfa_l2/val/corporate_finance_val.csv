0,"Carlos Velasquez, CFA, is a financial analyst with Embelesado, S.A., a Spanish manufacturer of sailboats and sailing equipment. Velasquez is evaluating a proposal for Embelesado to build sailboats for a foreign competitor that lacks production capacity and sells in a different market. The sailboat project is perceived to have the same risk as Embelesado's other projects.The proposal covers a limited time horizon—three years—after which the competitor expects to be situated in a new, larger production facility. The limited time horizon appeals to Embelesado, which currently has excess capacity but expects to begin its own product expansion in slightly more than three years.Velasquez has collected much of the information necessary to evaluate this proposal in Exhibits 1 and 2.

Velasquez recognizes that Embelesado is currently financed at its target capital structure and expects that the capital structure will be maintained if the sailboat project is undertaken. Embelesado's managers disagree, however, about the method that should be used to evaluate capital budgeting proposals.One of Embelesado's vice presidents asks Velasquez the following questions:Question 1Will projects that meet a corporation's payback criterion for acceptance necessarily have a positive net present value (NPV)?Question 2For mutually exclusive projects, will the NPV and internal rate of return (IRR) methods necessarily agree on project ranking?Question 3For the sailboat project, what will be the effects of using accelerated depreciation (for both book and tax accounting) instead of straight-line depreciation on a) the NPV and b) the total net cash flow in the terminal year?Question 4Assuming a 13 percent discount rate, what will be the increase in the sailboat project's NPV if the expected market value of the facility at end of project is €15 million rather than €5 million?
In response to Question 3, what are the most likely effects on the NPV and the total net cash flow in the terminal year, respectively?",Increase Increase,Increase Decrease,Decrease Increase,,B
1,"Modern Auto, an automobile parts supplier, has made an offer to acquire Sky Systems, creator of software for the airline industry. The offer is to pay Sky Systems' shareholders the current market value of their stock in Modern Auto's stock. The relevant information it used in those calculations is given below:
| Modern Auto | Sky Systems |
| Share price | $40 | $25 |
| Number of outstanding shares(ml lions) | 40 | 15 |
| Eam ngs(ml lions) | $100 | $30 |


Although the total earnings of the combined company will not increase and are estimated to be $130 million, Charles Wilhelm (treasurer of Modern Auto) argues that there are two attractive reasons to merge. First, Wilhelm says, “The merger of Modern Auto and Sky Systems will result in lower risk for our shareholders because of the diversification effect.” Second, Wilhelm also says, “If our EPS increases, our stock price will increase in line with the EPS increase because our P/E will stay the same.”Sky Systems managers are not interested in the offer by Modern Auto. The managers, instead, approach HiFly, Inc., which is in the same industry as Sky Systems, to see if it would be interested in acquiring Sky Systems. HiFly is interested, and both companies believe there will be synergies from this acquisition. If HiFly were to acquire Sky Systems, it would do so by paying $400 million in cash.
The acquisition of Sky Systems by Modern Auto and the acquisition of Sky Systems by HiFly, respectively, would be examples of a:",vertical merger and a horizontal merger.,conglomerate merger and a vertical merger.,conglomerate merger and a horizontal merger.,,C
2,"The capital budgeting committee for Laroache Industries is meeting. Laroache is a North American conglomerate that has several divisions. One of these divisions, Laroache Livery, operates a large fleet of vans. Laroache’s management is evaluating whether it is optimal to operate new vans for two, three, or four years before replacing them. The managers have estimated the investment outlay, annual after-tax operating expenses, and after-tax salvage cash flows for each of the service lives. Because revenues and some operating costs are unaffected by the choice of service life, they were ignored in the analysis. Laroache Livery’s opportunity cost of funds is 10 percent. The following table gives the cash flows in thousands of Canadian dollars (C$).
| Service Life | Invest men | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 |
| 2 years | -40，000 | -12，000 | -15，000 |
| 3 years | -40，000 | -12，000 | -15，000 | -20，000 |
| 4 years | -40，000 | -12，000 | -15，000 | -20，000 | -25，000 |


Schoeman Products, another division of Laroache, has evaluated several investment projects and now must choose the subset of them that fits within its C$40 million capital budget. The outlays and NPVs for the six projects are given below. Schoeman cannot buy fractional projects and must buy all or none of a project. The currency amounts are in millions of Canadian dollars.

Schoeman wants to determine which subset of the six projects is optimal.A final proposal comes from the division Society Services, which has an investment opportunity with a real option to invest further if conditions warrant. The crucial details are as follows:The original project:An outlay of C$190 million at time zero.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is “low.”Additional cash flows with the optional expansion project:An outlay of C$190 million at time one.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “low.”Whether demand is “high” or “low” in Years 1–10 will be revealed during the first year. The probability of “high” demand is 0.50, and the probability of “low” demand is 0.50.The option to make the expansion investment depends on making the initial investment. If the initial investment is not made, the option to expand does not exist.The required rate of return is 10 percent.Society Services wants to evaluate its investment alternatives.The internal auditor for Laroache Industries has made several suggestions for improving capital budgeting processes at the company. The internal auditor’s suggestions are as follows:Suggestion 1“In order to put all capital budgeting proposals on an equal footing, the projects should all use the risk-free rate for the required rate of return.”Suggestion 2“Because you cannot exercise both of them, you should not permit a given project to have both an abandonment option and an expansion/growth option.”Suggestion 3“When rationing capital, it is better to choose the portfolio of investments that maximizes the company NPV than the portfolio that maximizes the company IRR.”Suggestion 4“Project betas should be used for establishing the required rate of return whenever the project’s beta is different from the company’s beta.”
Should the capital budgeting committee accept the internal auditor’s first and second suggestions, respectively?",No for Suggestions 1 and 2.,No for Suggestion 1 and Yes for Suggestion 2.,Yes for Suggestion 1 and No for Suggestion 2.,,A

6,"Maximilian Bohm is reviewing several capital budgeting proposals from subsidiaries of his company. Although his reviews deal with several details that may seem like minutiae, the company places a premium on the care it exercises in making its investment decisions.The first proposal is a project for Richie Express, which is investing $500,000, all in fixed capital, in a project that will have operating income after taxes of $20,000 and depreciation of $40,000 each year for the next three years. Richie Express will sell the asset in three years, paying 30 percent taxes on any excess of the selling price over book value. The proposal indicates that a $647,500 terminal selling price will enable the company to earn a 15 percent internal rate of return on the investment. Bohm doubts that this terminal value estimate is correct.Another proposal concerns Gasup Company, which does natural gas exploration. A new investment has been identified by the Gasup finance department with the following projected cash flows:● Investment outlays are $6 million immediately and $1 million at the end of the first year.● After-tax operating cash flows are $0.5 million at the end of the first year and $4 million at the end of each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth years. In addition, an after-tax outflow occurs at the end of the five-year project that has not been included in the operating cash flows: $5 million required for environmental cleanup.● The required rate of return on natural gas exploration is 18 percent.The Gasup analyst is unsure about the calculation of the NPV and the IRR because the outlay is staged over two years.Finally, Dominion Company is evaluating two mutually exclusive projects: The Pinto grinder involves an outlay of $100,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $45,000, an after-tax salvage value of $25,000, and a three-year life. The Bolten grinder has an outlay of $125,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $47,000, an after-tax salvage value of $20,000, and a four-year life. The required rate of return is 10 percent. The net present value (NPV) and equivalent annual annuity (EAA) of the Pinto grinder are $30,691 and $12,341, respectively. Whichever grinder is chosen, it will have to be replaced at the end of its service life. The analyst is unsure about which grinder should be chosen.Bohm and his colleague Beth Goldberg have an extended conversation about capital budgeting issues, including several comments listed below. Goldberg makes two comments about real options:Comment 1“The abandonment option is valuable, but it should be exercised only when the abandonment value is above the amount of the original investment.”Comment 2“If the cost of a real option is less than its value, this will increase the NPV of the investment project in which the real option is embedded.”Bohm also makes several comments about specific projects under consideration:Comment AThe land and building were purchased five years ago for $10 million. This is the amount that should now be included in the fixed capital investment.”Comment B“We can improve the project's NPV by using the after-tax cost of debt as the discount rate. If we finance the project with 100 percent debt, this discount rate would be appropriate.”Comment C“It is generally safer to use the NPV than the IRR in making capital budgeting decisions. However, when evaluating mutually exclusive projects, if the projects have conventional cash flow patterns and have the same investment outlays, it is acceptable to use either the NPV or IRR.”Comment D“You should not base a capital budgeting decision on its immediate impact on earnings per share (EPS).”
The NPV and IRR, respectively, of the Gasup Company investment are closest to:","$509,600 and 21.4%.","$509,600 and 31.3%.","$946,700 and 31.3%.",,A
7,"Josh Logan is a buy-side equity analyst who follows Durtech. Logan's supervisor believes that Durtech is a likely takeover candidate and has asked Logan to estimate the company's value per share in the event of an “all stock” takeover bid. Logan plans to estimate Durtech's value per share using three approaches: discounted cash flow, comparable company analysis, and comparable transaction analysis.Durtech has 1.2 million common shares outstanding and no outstanding long-term debt or preferred stock. Logan estimates that Durtech's free cash flows at the end of the next three years will be $5.0 million, $6.0 million, and $7.0 million, respectively. After Year 3, he projects that free cash flow will grow at 5 percent per year. He determines the appropriate discount rate for this free cash flow stream is 15 percent per year.Applying discounted cash flow analysis to the preceding information, Logan determines that Durtech’s fair enterprise value is $61.8 million. In a separate analysis based on ratios, Logan estimates that at the end of the third year, Durtech will be worth 10 times its Year 3 free cash flow.Logan gathers data on two companies comparable to Durtech: Alphatech and Betatech. He believes that price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and price-to-book-value per share of these companies should be used to value Durtech. The relevant data for the three companies are given in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Valuation Variables for Dur tech and Comparable Companies |
| Valuation Variables | Alphatech | Beta tech | Dur tech |
| Current stock price(S) | 72.00 | 45.00 | 24.00 |
| Eam ings per share(S) | 2.00 | 1.50 | 1.00 |
| Sales per share(S) | 32.00 | 22.50 | 16.00 |
| Book value per share(S) | 18.00 | 10.00 | 8.00 |


Logan also identifies one recent takeover transaction and analyzes its takeover premium (the amount by which its takeover price per share exceeds its current stock price). Omegatech is comparable to the possible transaction on Durtech. Omegatech had a stock price of $44.40 per share prior to a newspaper report of a takeover rumor. After the takeover rumor was reported, the price rose immediately to $60.30 per share. Eventually, the takeover offer was accepted by Omegatech's shareholders for $55.00 per share. One-year trailing earnings per share for Omegatech immediately prior to the takeover were $1.25 per share.
Based on Exhibit 1 and the mean of each of the valuation ratios, Logan's estimate of Durtech's value per share should be closest to:",$30.44.,$33.67.,$34.67.,,B
8,"Mark Zin and Stella Lee are CEO and CFO, respectively, of Moonbase Corporation. They are concerned that Moonbase is undervalued and subject to a hostile takeover bid. To assess the value of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn Corporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.
| Relative Valuation Ratio | Jupiter | Saturn | Voyager |
| P/E | 23.00 | 19.50 | 21.50 |
| P/B | 4.24 | 5.25 | 4.91 |
| P/CF | 12.60 | 11.40 | 13.30 |


Zin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation ratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share, earnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share. Using the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that Moonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of a subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the subsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action should be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to the corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to succeed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more difficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our shareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to current market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put. The put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to current market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors with the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase governance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe characteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1: Moonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the firm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the board of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not employed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company and thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit committee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task, with an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is particularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate Governance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders, investment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special attention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These policies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the board and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment of the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided of directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management and compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a highly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an expanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an independent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship requirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the board of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or compensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that Steris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.
With regard to poison pills and puts, Lee's comments are:",correct.,incorrect with regard to the poison put.,incorrect with regard to the poison pill.,,B

She has been very frustrated by the number of job applicants who, in spite of their stellar pedigrees, seem to have little understanding of basic financial concepts. Yang has written a set of conceptual questions and simple problems for the human resources department to use to screen for the better candidates in the applicant pool. A few of her corporate finance questions and problems follow.Concept 1“A company invests in depreciable assets, financed partly by issuing fixed rate bonds. If inflation is lower than expected, the value of the real tax savings from depreciation and the value of the real after-tax interest expense are both reduced.”Concept 2“Sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis are useful tools for estimating the impact on a project’s NPV of changing the value of one capital budgeting input variable at a time.”Concept 3“When comparing two mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives, the IRR is a good approach for choosing the better project because it does not require equal lives.”Concept 4“Project specific betas should be used instead of company betas whenever the risk of the project differs from that of the company.”Problem“Bo Gansu Electronics Co., Ltd. is investing CNY100 in a project that is being depreciated straight line to zero over a two- year life with no salvage value. The project will generate earnings before interest and taxes of CNY50 each year for two years. Bo Gansu Company’s weighted average cost of capital and required rate of return for the project are both 12%, and its tax rate is 30%.”
For Concept 1, the statement is correct regarding the effects on:","the real tax savings from depreciation, but incorrect regarding the real after-tax interest expense.",both the real tax savings from depreciation and the real after-tax interest expense.,neither the real tax savings from depreciation nor the real after-tax interest expense.,,C
10,"Karen Maghami is a portfolio manager for a mutual fund. Maghami, working with analyst Marcel Lynbrock, is researching two companies: Syvie Electric and EnileGEN. Located in the same country, both companies produce electricity from conventional and renewable sources. Maghami wants to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the analysis of each company’s financial statements.Syvie Electric is a stock exchange- listed, state- owned enterprise (SOE). The sovereign government holds 58% of shares; remaining shares are publicly traded. EnileGEN is a public company owned primarily by institutional investors.Lynbrock starts with an analysis of corporate governance factors. Relevant information about the two companies is summarized in Exhibit 1.

| Ownership Information and Voting Policies |  |
| Percentage of shares owned by the largest shareholder | 58% | 9% |

| Percentage of directors with experience in industry | 27% | 88% |
| Remuneration Policies |  |
| Clawback policy | No | Yes |
| Say-on-pay provision | Yes | No |


After reviewing the corporate governance information, Maghami and Lynbrock focus on factors related to environmental and social considerations. Lynbrock asks Maghami, “What resource would you recommend using to find a list of ESG factors material to the electricity generation sector?”Next, Maghami and Lynbrock discuss the effect of expected regulatory changes on stock and bond values for both companies. The government recently announced that it intends to authorize a new environmental regulation requiring that a minimum of 35% of electricity be produced from renewable sources. ?The exact timing of the new regulation is unknown, but EnileGEN already exceeds the minimum level by a significant margin. Maghami notes that the new regulation should give EnileGEN a competitive edge in the industry, and for scenario analysis purposes, she asks Lynbrock to assume that the regulation will take effect in two years. Lynbrock uses a discounted cash flow model to value EnileGEN stock under the assumption requested by Maghami.Lynbrock believes that the new regulation will make three of Syvie Electric’s coal-fired power stations no longer financially viable within 10 years following implementation. Maghami asks Lynbrock to estimate the potential effect on Syvie Electric’s balance sheet and the potential impact on the value of Syvie Electric bonds.Maghami reads in Syvie Electric’s most recent financial statements that the company plans to issue green bonds. Maghami asks Lynbrock to evaluate any possible valuation risks or opportunities associated with green bonds. Lynbrock tells Maghami the following:Statement 1: Green bonds offer higher protection for an investor because they typically are backed by the income derived from the environmental project they are used to fund.Statement 2: Issuing green bonds ensures a lower cost of capital because the green feature typically results in a tighter credit spread compared with conventional bonds.Statement 3: A unique risk related to green bonds is greenwashing, which is the risk that the bond’s proceeds are not actually used for a beneficial environmental or climate-related project.
To reflect the effect of the regulatory scenario requested by Maghami on EnileGEN’s stock value, Lynbrock should:",increase the credit spread.,decrease the discount rate.,increase projected operating costs.,,B

However, when evaluating mutually exclusive projects, if the projects have conventional cash flow patterns and have the same investment outlays, it is acceptable to use either the NPV or IRR.”Comment D“You should not base a capital budgeting decision on its immediate impact on earnings per share (EPS).”

She has been very frustrated by the number of job applicants who, in spite of their stellar pedigrees, seem to have little understanding of basic financial concepts. Yang has written a set of conceptual questions and simple problems for the human resources department to use to screen for the better candidates in the applicant pool. A few of her corporate finance questions and problems follow.Concept 1“A company invests in depreciable assets, financed partly by issuing fixed rate bonds. If inflation is lower than expected, the value of the real tax savings from depreciation and the value of the real after-tax interest expense are both reduced.”Concept 2“Sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis are useful tools for estimating the impact on a project’s NPV of changing the value of one capital budgeting input variable at a time.”Concept 3“When comparing two mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives, the IRR is a good approach for choosing the better project because it does not require equal lives.”Concept 4“Project specific betas should be used instead of company betas whenever the risk of the project differs from that of the company.”Problem“Bo Gansu Electronics Co., Ltd. is investing CNY100 in a project that is being depreciated straight line to zero over a two- year life with no salvage value.

White believes the domestic and global economies will grow slightly below average over the next two years, but she is also concerned about the possibility of a mild recession taking hold. She has been asked to review the companies that she covers, and she has collected information about them, presented in Exhibit 1. White has estimated that earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) will remain constant for all five companies for the foreseeable future.

Based on conversations with management of the five companies, as well as on her own independent research and analysis, White notes the following:Aquarius:● has lower bonding costs than does Bema.● has a higher percentage of tangible assets to total assets than does Bema.● has a higher degree of operating leverage than does Bema.Garth:● invests significantly less in research and development than does Holte.● has a more highly developed corporate governance system than does Holte.● has more business risk than does Holte.In addition, White has reached various conclusions regarding announcements by Bema, Garth, and Vega:Announcement Bema has announced that it will issue debt and use the proceeds to repurchase shares. As a result of this debt-financed share repurchase program, Bema indicates that its debt/equity ratio will increase to 0.6 and its before-tax cost of debt will be 6%.Conclusion As a result of the announced program, Bema's total market value should decrease relative to Aquarius's.Announcement Garth has announced that it plans to abandon the prior policy of all-equity financing by the issuance of ￡1 million in debt in order to buy back an equivalent amount of equity. Garth's before-tax cost of debt is 6%.Conclusion This change in capital structure is reasonable, but Garth should take care subsequently to maintain a lower D/E ratio than Holte.Announcement Vega has announced that it intends to raise capital next year, but is unsure of the appropriate method of raising capital.Conclusion White has concluded that Vega should apply the pecking order theory to determine the appropriate method of raising capital.

15,"Modern Auto, an automobile parts supplier, has made an offer to acquire Sky Systems, creator of software for the airline industry. The offer is to pay Sky Systems' shareholders the current market value of their stock in Modern Auto's stock. The relevant information it used in those calculations is given below:

Although the total earnings of the combined company will not increase and are estimated to be $130 million, Charles Wilhelm (treasurer of Modern Auto) argues that there are two attractive reasons to merge. First, Wilhelm says, “The merger of Modern Auto and Sky Systems will result in lower risk for our shareholders because of the diversification effect.” Second, Wilhelm also says, “If our EPS increases, our stock price will increase in line with the EPS increase because our P/E will stay the same.”Sky Systems managers are not interested in the offer by Modern Auto. The managers, instead, approach HiFly, Inc., which is in the same industry as Sky Systems, to see if it would be interested in acquiring Sky Systems. HiFly is interested, and both companies believe there will be synergies from this acquisition. If HiFly were to acquire Sky Systems, it would do so by paying $400 million in cash.

The financial predictions for the capital project are as follows:● Fixed capital outlay is INR1.50 billion.● Investment in net working capital is INR0.40 billion.● Straight-line depreciation is over a six-year period with zero salvage value.● Project life is 12 years.● Additional annual revenues are INR0.10 billion.● Annual cash operating expenses are reduced by INR0.25 billion.● The capital equipment is sold for INR0.50 billion in 12 years.● Tax rate is 40 percent.● Required rate of return is 12 percent.Simpson is evaluating this investment to see whether it has the potential to affect Bayonne Pharma's stock price.Simpson estimates the NPV of the project to be INR0.41 billion, which should increase the value of the company.Simpson is evaluating the effects of other changes to her capital budgeting assumptions. She wants to know the effect of a switch from straight-line to accelerated depreciation on the company's operating income and the project's NPV. She also believes that the initial outlay might be much smaller than initially assumed. Specifically, she thinks the outlay for fixed capital might be INR0.24 billion lower, with no change in salvage value.When reviewing her work, Simpson's supervisor provides the following comments. “I note that you are relying heavily on the NPV approach to valuing the investment decision. I don't think you should use an IRR because of the multiple IRR problem that is likely to arise with the Bayonne Pharma project. However, the equivalent annual annuity would be a more appropriate measure to use for the project than the NPV. I suggest that you compute an EAA.”

18,"Josh Logan is a buy-side equity analyst who follows Durtech. Logan's supervisor believes that Durtech is a likely takeover candidate and has asked Logan to estimate the company's value per share in the event of an “all stock” takeover bid. Logan plans to estimate Durtech's value per share using three approaches: discounted cash flow, comparable company analysis, and comparable transaction analysis.Durtech has 1.2 million common shares outstanding and no outstanding long-term debt or preferred stock. Logan estimates that Durtech's free cash flows at the end of the next three years will be $5.0 million, $6.0 million, and $7.0 million, respectively. After Year 3, he projects that free cash flow will grow at 5 percent per year. He determines the appropriate discount rate for this free cash flow stream is 15 percent per year.Applying discounted cash flow analysis to the preceding information, Logan determines that Durtech’s fair enterprise value is $61.8 million. In a separate analysis based on ratios, Logan estimates that at the end of the third year, Durtech will be worth 10 times its Year 3 free cash flow.Logan gathers data on two companies comparable to Durtech: Alphatech and Betatech. He believes that price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and price-to-book-value per share of these companies should be used to value Durtech. The relevant data for the three companies are given in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Valuation Variables for Dur tech and Comparable Companies |
| Valuation Variables | Alphatech | Beta tech | Dur tech |
| Current stock price(S) | 72.00 | 45.00 | 24.00 |

| Sales per share(S) | 32.00 | 22.50 | 16.00 |
| Book value per share(S) | 18.00 | 10.00 | 8.00 |


Logan also identifies one recent takeover transaction and analyzes its takeover premium (the amount by which its takeover price per share exceeds its current stock price). Omegatech is comparable to the possible transaction on Durtech. Omegatech had a stock price of $44.40 per share prior to a newspaper report of a takeover rumor. After the takeover rumor was reported, the price rose immediately to $60.30 per share. Eventually, the takeover offer was accepted by Omegatech's shareholders for $55.00 per share. One-year trailing earnings per share for Omegatech immediately prior to the takeover were $1.25 per share.
Using comparable transaction analysis, Logan's estimate of the fair acquisition value per share for Durtech is closest to:",$35.52.,$42.59.,$44.00.,,C

Velasquez is evaluating a proposal for Embelesado to build sailboats for a foreign competitor that lacks production capacity and sells in a different market. The sailboat project is perceived to have the same risk as Embelesado's other projects.The proposal covers a limited time horizon—three years—after which the competitor expects to be situated in a new, larger production facility. The limited time horizon appeals to Embelesado, which currently has excess capacity but expects to begin its own product expansion in slightly more than three years.Velasquez has collected much of the information necessary to evaluate this proposal in Exhibits 1 and 2.

Velasquez recognizes that Embelesado is currently financed at its target capital structure and expects that the capital structure will be maintained if the sailboat project is undertaken. Embelesado's managers disagree, however, about the method that should be used to evaluate capital budgeting proposals.One of Embelesado's vice presidents asks Velasquez the following questions:Question 1Will projects that meet a corporation's payback criterion for acceptance necessarily have a positive net present value (NPV)?Question 2For mutually exclusive projects, will the NPV and internal rate of return (IRR) methods necessarily agree on project ranking?Question 3For the sailboat project, what will be the effects of using accelerated depreciation (for both book and tax accounting) instead of straight-line depreciation on a) the NPV and b) the total net cash flow in the terminal year?Question 4Assuming a 13 percent discount rate, what will be the increase in the sailboat project's NPV if the expected market value of the facility at end of project is €15 million rather than €5 million?

Greengable owns a significant position with a large unrealized capital gain in Mosely Broadcast Group (MBG). On a recent conference call, MBG's management states that they plan to increase the proportion of debt in the company's capital structure. Andrade is concerned that any changes in MBG's capital structure will negatively affect the value of Greengable's investment.To evaluate the potential impact of such a capital structure change on Greengable's investment, she gathers the information about MBG given in Exhibit 1.

| Cost of capital if all equity-fiance d | 10.3% |
| Marginal tax rate | 35% |


Andrade expects that an increase in MBG's financial leverage will increase its costs of debt and equity. Based on an examination of similar companies in MBG's industry, Andrade estimates MBG's cost of debt and cost of equity at various debt-to-total capital ratios, as shown in Exhibit 2.

24,"The capital budgeting committee for Laroache Industries is meeting. Laroache is a North American conglomerate that has several divisions. One of these divisions, Laroache Livery, operates a large fleet of vans. Laroache’s management is evaluating whether it is optimal to operate new vans for two, three, or four years before replacing them. The managers have estimated the investment outlay, annual after-tax operating expenses, and after-tax salvage cash flows for each of the service lives. Because revenues and some operating costs are unaffected by the choice of service life, they were ignored in the analysis. Laroache Livery’s opportunity cost of funds is 10 percent. The following table gives the cash flows in thousands of Canadian dollars (C$).
| Service Life | Invest men | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 |
| 2 years | -40，000 | -12，000 | -15，000 |

| 4 years | -40，000 | -12，000 | -15，000 | -20，000 | -25，000 |


Schoeman Products, another division of Laroache, has evaluated several investment projects and now must choose the subset of them that fits within its C$40 million capital budget. The outlays and NPVs for the six projects are given below. Schoeman cannot buy fractional projects and must buy all or none of a project. The currency amounts are in millions of Canadian dollars.

Schoeman wants to determine which subset of the six projects is optimal.A final proposal comes from the division Society Services, which has an investment opportunity with a real option to invest further if conditions warrant. The crucial details are as follows:The original project:An outlay of C$190 million at time zero.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is “low.”Additional cash flows with the optional expansion project:An outlay of C$190 million at time one.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “low.”Whether demand is “high” or “low” in Years 1–10 will be revealed during the first year. The probability of “high” demand is 0.50, and the probability of “low” demand is 0.50.The option to make the expansion investment depends on making the initial investment. If the initial investment is not made, the option to expand does not exist.The required rate of return is 10 percent.Society Services wants to evaluate its investment alternatives.The internal auditor for Laroache Industries has made several suggestions for improving capital budgeting processes at the company. The internal auditor’s suggestions are as follows:Suggestion 1“In order to put all capital budgeting proposals on an equal footing, the projects should all use the risk-free rate for the required rate of return.”Suggestion 2“Because you cannot exercise both of them, you should not permit a given project to have both an abandonment option and an expansion/growth option.”Suggestion 3“When rationing capital, it is better to choose the portfolio of investments that maximizes the company NPV than the portfolio that maximizes the company IRR.”Suggestion 4“Project betas should be used for establishing the required rate of return whenever the project’s beta is different from the company’s beta.”

Using the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that Moonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of a subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the subsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action should be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to the corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to succeed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more difficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our shareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to current market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put. The put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to current market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors with the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase governance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe characteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1: Moonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the firm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the board of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not employed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company and thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit committee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task, with an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is particularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate Governance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders, investment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special attention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These policies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the board and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment of the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided of directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management and compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a highly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an expanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an independent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship requirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the board of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or compensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that Steris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.

Velasquez is evaluating a proposal for Embelesado to build sailboats for a foreign competitor that lacks production capacity and sells in a different market. The sailboat project is perceived to have the same risk as Embelesado's other projects.The proposal covers a limited time horizon—three years—after which the competitor expects to be situated in a new, larger production facility. The limited time horizon appeals to Embelesado, which currently has excess capacity but expects to begin its own product expansion in slightly more than three years.Velasquez has collected much of the information necessary to evaluate this proposal in Exhibits 1 and 2.

White believes the domestic and global economies will grow slightly below average over the next two years, but she is also concerned about the possibility of a mild recession taking hold. She has been asked to review the companies that she covers, and she has collected information about them, presented in Exhibit 1. White has estimated that earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) will remain constant for all five companies for the foreseeable future. Currency is in terms of the British pound (￡).The marginal corporate tax rate is 30% for all five companies.

| Weighted average cost of capital | 10% | 10% |


Based on conversations with management of the five companies, as well as on her own independent research and analysis, White notes the following:Aquarius:● has lower bonding costs than does Bema.● has a higher percentage of tangible assets to total assets than does Bema.● has a higher degree of operating leverage than does Bema.Garth:● invests significantly less in research and development than does Holte.● has a more highly developed corporate governance system than does Holte.● has more business risk than does Holte.In addition, White has reached various conclusions regarding announcements by Bema, Garth, and Vega:Announcement Bema has announced that it will issue debt and use the proceeds to repurchase shares. As a result of this debt-financed share repurchase program, Bema indicates that its debt/equity ratio will increase to 0.6 and its before-tax cost of debt will be 6%.Conclusion As a result of the announced program, Bema's total market value should decrease relative to Aquarius's.Announcement Garth has announced that it plans to abandon the prior policy of all-equity financing by the issuance of ￡1 million in debt in order to buy back an equivalent amount of equity. Garth's before-tax cost of debt is 6%.Conclusion This change in capital structure is reasonable, but Garth should take care subsequently to maintain a lower D/E ratio than Holte.Announcement Vega has announced that it intends to raise capital next year, but is unsure of the appropriate method of raising capital.Conclusion White has concluded that Vega should apply the pecking order theory to determine the appropriate method of raising capital.
Based on White's conclusion regarding determining the appropriate method of raising capital, Vega should raise capital in the following order:","debt, internal financing, equity.","equity, debt, internal financing.","internal financing, debt, equity.",,C

35,"Mark Zin and Stella Lee are CEO and CFO, respectively, of Moonbase Corporation. They are concerned that Moonbase is undervalued and subject to a hostile takeover bid. To assess the value of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn Corporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.
| Relative Valuation Ratio | Jupiter | Saturn | Voyager |

| P/B | 4.24 | 5.25 | 4.91 |

Zin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation ratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share, earnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share. Using the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that Moonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of a subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the subsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action should be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to the corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to succeed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more difficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our shareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to current market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put. The put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to current market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors with the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase governance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe characteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1: Moonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the firm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the board of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not employed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company and thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit committee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task, with an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is particularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate Governance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders, investment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special attention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These policies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the board and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment of the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided of directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management and compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a highly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an expanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an independent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship requirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the board of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or compensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that Steris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.

Greengable owns a significant position with a large unrealized capital gain in Mosely Broadcast Group (MBG). On a recent conference call, MBG's management states that they plan to increase the proportion of debt in the company's capital structure. Andrade is concerned that any changes in MBG's capital structure will negatively affect the value of Greengable's investment.To evaluate the potential impact of such a capital structure change on Greengable's investment, she gathers the information about MBG given in Exhibit 1.

| Cost of capital if all equity-fiance d | 10.3% |
| Marginal tax rate | 35% |


Andrade expects that an increase in MBG's financial leverage will increase its costs of debt and equity. Based on an examination of similar companies in MBG's industry, Andrade estimates MBG's cost of debt and cost of equity at various debt-to-total capital ratios, as shown in Exhibit 2.

According to the pecking order theory, MBG’s announced capital structure change may be optimal:",because debt is cheaper than equity on an after- tax basis.,if new equity is issued before new debt as a source of capital.,if new debt is issued after all internally generated funds are first used as sources of capital.,,C

38,"Maximilian Bohm is reviewing several capital budgeting proposals from subsidiaries of his company. Although his reviews deal with several details that may seem like minutiae, the company places a premium on the care it exercises in making its investment decisions.The first proposal is a project for Richie Express, which is investing $500,000, all in fixed capital, in a project that will have operating income after taxes of $20,000 and depreciation of $40,000 each year for the next three years. Richie Express will sell the asset in three years, paying 30 percent taxes on any excess of the selling price over book value. The proposal indicates that a $647,500 terminal selling price will enable the company to earn a 15 percent internal rate of return on the investment. Bohm doubts that this terminal value estimate is correct.Another proposal concerns Gasup Company, which does natural gas exploration. A new investment has been identified by the Gasup finance department with the following projected cash flows:● Investment outlays are $6 million immediately and $1 million at the end of the first year.● After-tax operating cash flows are $0.5 million at the end of the first year and $4 million at the end of each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth years. In addition, an after-tax outflow occurs at the end of the five-year project that has not been included in the operating cash flows: $5 million required for environmental cleanup.● The required rate of return on natural gas exploration is 18 percent.The Gasup analyst is unsure about the calculation of the NPV and the IRR because the outlay is staged over two years.Finally, Dominion Company is evaluating two mutually exclusive projects: The Pinto grinder involves an outlay of $100,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $45,000, an after-tax salvage value of $25,000, and a three-year life. The Bolten grinder has an outlay of $125,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $47,000, an after-tax salvage value of $20,000, and a four-year life. The required rate of return is 10 percent. The net present value (NPV) and equivalent annual annuity (EAA) of the Pinto grinder are $30,691 and $12,341, respectively. Whichever grinder is chosen, it will have to be replaced at the end of its service life. The analyst is unsure about which grinder should be chosen.Bohm and his colleague Beth Goldberg have an extended conversation about capital budgeting issues, including several comments listed below. Goldberg makes two comments about real options:Comment 1“The abandonment option is valuable, but it should be exercised only when the abandonment value is above the amount of the original investment.”Comment 2“If the cost of a real option is less than its value, this will increase the NPV of the investment project in which the real option is embedded.”Bohm also makes several comments about specific projects under consideration:Comment AThe land and building were purchased five years ago for $10 million. This is the amount that should now be included in the fixed capital investment.”Comment B“We can improve the project's NPV by using the after-tax cost of debt as the discount rate. If we finance the project with 100 percent debt, this discount rate would be appropriate.”Comment C“It is generally safer to use the NPV than the IRR in making capital budgeting decisions. However, when evaluating mutually exclusive projects, if the projects have conventional cash flow patterns and have the same investment outlays, it is acceptable to use either the NPV or IRR.”Comment D“You should not base a capital budgeting decision on its immediate impact on earnings per share (EPS).”
Is Bohm most likely correct regarding Comment A about the $10 million investment and Comment B about using the after-tax cost of debt?",No for both comments.,Yes for both comments.,No for Comment A and Yes for Comment B.,,A

At the end of the project, the net working capital investment will be recovered.● Tax rate of 40 percent.● Based on the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return is 12 percent.Hernández estimates the expected net present value (NPV) of the project to be €975,538 and the internal rate of return (IRR) to be 24.6 percent. She also performs a sensitivity analysis by changing the input variable assumptions used in her initial analysis.When reviewing Hernández's work, her supervisor, Arturo Costa, notes that she did not include changes in the depreciation method, initial fixed capital outlay, or inflation assumptions in her sensitivity analysis. As a result, Costa asks the following questions:Question 1“What would be the effect on the project's NPV if the initial fixed capital equipment outlay increased from €2,750,000 to €3,000,000, everything else held constant?”Question 2“How would a higher than expected inflation rate affect the value of the real tax savings from depreciation and the value of the real after-tax interest expense, everything else held constant?”Question 3“You are using a required rate of return of 12 percent when the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 10 percent. Why are you using a required rate of return for the project greater than the company's WACC?”Before ending the meeting, Costa tells Hernández: “Last year the company produced a prototype at a cost of €500,000.

She wants to know the effect of a switch from straight-line to accelerated depreciation on the company's operating income and the project's NPV. She also believes that the initial outlay might be much smaller than initially assumed. Specifically, she thinks the outlay for fixed capital might be INR0.24 billion lower, with no change in salvage value.When reviewing her work, Simpson's supervisor provides the following comments. “I note that you are relying heavily on the NPV approach to valuing the investment decision. I don't think you should use an IRR because of the multiple IRR problem that is likely to arise with the Bayonne Pharma project. However, the equivalent annual annuity would be a more appropriate measure to use for the project than the NPV. I suggest that you compute an EAA.”

After reviewing the corporate governance information, Maghami and Lynbrock focus on factors related to environmental and social considerations. Lynbrock asks Maghami, “What resource would you recommend using to find a list of ESG factors material to the electricity generation sector?”Next, Maghami and Lynbrock discuss the effect of expected regulatory changes on stock and bond values for both companies. The government recently announced that it intends to authorize a new environmental regulation requiring that a minimum of 35% of electricity be produced from renewable sources. ?The exact timing of the new regulation is unknown, but EnileGEN already exceeds the minimum level by a significant margin. Maghami notes that the new regulation should give EnileGEN a competitive edge in the industry, and for scenario analysis purposes, she asks Lynbrock to assume that the regulation will take effect in two years. Lynbrock uses a discounted cash flow model to value EnileGEN stock under the assumption requested by Maghami.Lynbrock believes that the new regulation will make three of Syvie Electric’s coal-fired power stations no longer financially viable within 10 years following implementation. Maghami asks Lynbrock to estimate the potential effect on Syvie Electric’s balance sheet and the potential impact on the value of Syvie Electric bonds.Maghami reads in Syvie Electric’s most recent financial statements that the company plans to issue green bonds. Maghami asks Lynbrock to evaluate any possible valuation risks or opportunities associated with green bonds. Lynbrock tells Maghami the following:Statement 1: Green bonds offer higher protection for an investor because they typically are backed by the income derived from the environmental project they are used to fund.Statement 2: Issuing green bonds ensures a lower cost of capital because the green feature typically results in a tighter credit spread compared with conventional bonds.Statement 3: A unique risk related to green bonds is greenwashing, which is the risk that the bond’s proceeds are not actually used for a beneficial environmental or climate-related project.

White believes the domestic and global economies will grow slightly below average over the next two years, but she is also concerned about the possibility of a mild recession taking hold. She has been asked to review the companies that she covers, and she has collected information about them, presented in Exhibit 1. White has estimated that earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) will remain constant for all five companies for the foreseeable future. Currency is in terms of the British pound (￡).The marginal corporate tax rate is 30% for all five companies.

Based on conversations with management of the five companies, as well as on her own independent research and analysis, White notes the following:Aquarius:● has lower bonding costs than does Bema.● has a higher percentage of tangible assets to total assets than does Bema.● has a higher degree of operating leverage than does Bema.Garth:● invests significantly less in research and development than does Holte.● has a more highly developed corporate governance system than does Holte.● has more business risk than does Holte.In addition, White has reached various conclusions regarding announcements by Bema, Garth, and Vega:AnnouncementBema has announced that it will issue debt and use the proceeds to repurchase shares. As a result of this debt-financed share repurchase program, Bema indicates that its debt/equity ratio will increase to 0.6 and its before-tax cost of debt will be 6%.ConclusionAs a result of the announced program, Bema's total market value should decrease relative to Aquarius's.AnnouncementGarth has announced that it plans to abandon the prior policy of all-equity financing by the issuance of ￡1 million in debt in order to buy back an equivalent amount of equity. Garth's before-tax cost of debt is 6%.ConclusionThis change in capital structure is reasonable, but Garth should take care subsequently to maintain a lower D/E ratio than Holte.AnnouncementVega has announced that it intends to raise capital next year, but is unsure of the appropriate method of raising capital.ConclusionWhite has concluded that Vega should apply the pecking order theory to determine the appropriate method of raising capital.

57,"Maximilian Bohm is reviewing several capital budgeting proposals from subsidiaries of his company. Although his reviews deal with several details that may seem like minutiae, the company places a premium on the care it exercises in making its investment decisions.The first proposal is a project for Richie Express, which is investing $500,000, all in fixed capital, in a project that will have operating income after taxes of $20,000 and depreciation of $40,000 each year for the next three years. Richie Express will sell the asset in three years, paying 30 percent taxes on any excess of the selling price over book value. The proposal indicates that a $647,500 terminal selling price will enable the company to earn a 15 percent internal rate of return on the investment. Bohm doubts that this terminal value estimate is correct.Another proposal concerns Gasup Company, which does natural gas exploration. A new investment has been identified by the Gasup finance department with the following projected cash flows:● Investment outlays are $6 million immediately and $1 million at the end of the first year.● After-tax operating cash flows are $0.5 million at the end of the first year and $4 million at the end of each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth years. In addition, an after-tax outflow occurs at the end of the five-year project that has not been included in the operating cash flows: $5 million required for environmental cleanup.● The required rate of return on natural gas exploration is 18 percent.The Gasup analyst is unsure about the calculation of the NPV and the IRR because the outlay is staged over two years.Finally, Dominion Company is evaluating two mutually exclusive projects: The Pinto grinder involves an outlay of $100,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $45,000, an after-tax salvage value of $25,000, and a three-year life. The Bolten grinder has an outlay of $125,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $47,000, an after-tax salvage value of $20,000, and a four-year life. The required rate of return is 10 percent. The net present value (NPV) and equivalent annual annuity (EAA) of the Pinto grinder are $30,691 and $12,341, respectively. Whichever grinder is chosen, it will have to be replaced at the end of its service life. The analyst is unsure about which grinder should be chosen.Bohm and his colleague Beth Goldberg have an extended conversation about capital budgeting issues, including several comments listed below. Goldberg makes two comments about real options:Comment 1“The abandonment option is valuable, but it should be exercised only when the abandonment value is above the amount of the original investment.”Comment 2“If the cost of a real option is less than its value, this will increase the NPV of the investment project in which the real option is embedded.”Bohm also makes several comments about specific projects under consideration:Comment AThe land and building were purchased five years ago for $10 million. This is the amount that should now be included in the fixed capital investment.”Comment B“We can improve the project's NPV by using the after-tax cost of debt as the discount rate. If we finance the project with 100 percent debt, this discount rate would be appropriate.”Comment C“It is generally safer to use the NPV than the IRR in making capital budgeting decisions. However, when evaluating mutually exclusive projects, if the projects have conventional cash flow patterns and have the same investment outlays, it is acceptable to use either the NPV or IRR.”Comment D“You should not base a capital budgeting decision on its immediate impact on earnings per share (EPS).”
Of the two grinders that the Dominion Company is evaluating, B?hm should recommend the:",Bolten grinder because its NPV is higher than the Pinto grinder NPV.,Bolten grinder because its EAA is higher than the Pinto grinder EAA.,Pinto grinder because its EAA is higher than the Bolten grinder EAA.,,C

Schoeman wants to determine which subset of the six projects is optimal.A final proposal comes from the division Society Services, which has an investment opportunity with a real option to invest further if conditions warrant. The crucial details are as follows:The original project:An outlay of C$190 million at time zero.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 1–10 if demand is “low.”Additional cash flows with the optional expansion project:An outlay of C$190 million at time one.Cash flows of C$40 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “high.”Cash flows of C$20 million per year for Years 2–10 if demand is “low.”Whether demand is “high” or “low” in Years 1–10 will be revealed during the first year. The probability of “high” demand is 0.50, and the probability of “low” demand is 0.50.The option to make the expansion investment depends on making the initial investment. If the initial investment is not made, the option to expand does not exist.The required rate of return is 10 percent.Society Services wants to evaluate its investment alternatives.The internal auditor for Laroache Industries has made several suggestions for improving capital budgeting processes at the company. The internal auditor’s suggestions are as follows:Suggestion 1“In order to put all capital budgeting proposals on an equal footing, the projects should all use the risk-free rate for the required rate of return.”Suggestion 2“Because you cannot exercise both of them, you should not permit a given project to have both an abandonment option and an expansion/growth option.”Suggestion 3“When rationing capital, it is better to choose the portfolio of investments that maximizes the company NPV than the portfolio that maximizes the company IRR.”Suggestion 4“Project betas should be used for establishing the required rate of return whenever the project’s beta is different from the company’s beta.”

63,"María Hernández is a sell-side analyst covering the electronics industry in Spain. One of the companies she follows, SG Electronics, S.A., has recently announced plans to begin producing and selling a new series of video cameras. Hernández estimates that this project will increase the value of the company and, consequently, she plans on changing her research opinion on the company from a “hold” to a “buy.” Her initial financial predictions for the project are:● Fixed capital equipment outlay is €2,750,000.● At the beginning of the project, a required increase in current assets of €200,000 and a required increase in current liabilities of €125,000.● Straight-line depreciation to zero over a five-year life.● Project life of five years.● Incremental annual unit sales of 3,000 at a unit price of €600.● Annual fixed cash expenses of €125,000; variable cash expenses of €125 per unit.● The capital equipment is expected to be sold for €450,000 at the end of Year 5. At the end of the project, the net working capital investment will be recovered.● Tax rate of 40 percent.● Based on the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return is 12 percent.Hernández estimates the expected net present value (NPV) of the project to be €975,538 and the internal rate of return (IRR) to be 24.6 percent. She also performs a sensitivity analysis by changing the input variable assumptions used in her initial analysis.When reviewing Hernández's work, her supervisor, Arturo Costa, notes that she did not include changes in the depreciation method, initial fixed capital outlay, or inflation assumptions in her sensitivity analysis. As a result, Costa asks the following questions:Question 1“What would be the effect on the project's NPV if the initial fixed capital equipment outlay increased from €2,750,000 to €3,000,000, everything else held constant?”Question 2“How would a higher than expected inflation rate affect the value of the real tax savings from depreciation and the value of the real after-tax interest expense, everything else held constant?”Question 3“You are using a required rate of return of 12 percent when the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 10 percent. Why are you using a required rate of return for the project greater than the company's WACC?”Before ending the meeting, Costa tells Hernández: “Last year the company produced a prototype at a cost of €500,000. Now management is having doubts about the market appeal of the product in its current design, and so they are considering delaying the start of the project for a year, until the prototype can be shown to industry experts.”
Hernández's best response to Costa's second question is that:",real tax savings from depreciation and real interest expense would be lower.,real tax savings from depreciation would be higher and real interest expense would be lower.,real tax savings from depreciation would be lower and real interest expense would be higher.,,A

Greengable owns a significant position with a large unrealized capital gain in Mosely Broadcast Group (MBG). On a recent conference call, MBG's management states that they plan to increase the proportion of debt in the company's capital structure. Andrade is concerned that any changes in MBG's capital structure will negatively affect the value of Greengable's investment.To evaluate the potential impact of such a capital structure change on Greengable's investment, she gathers the information about MBG given in Exhibit 1.

69,"Maximilian Bohm is reviewing several capital budgeting proposals from subsidiaries of his company. Although his reviews deal with several details that may seem like minutiae, the company places a premium on the care it exercises in making its investment decisions.The first proposal is a project for Richie Express, which is investing $500,000, all in fixed capital, in a project that will have operating income after taxes of $20,000 and depreciation of $40,000 each year for the next three years. Richie Express will sell the asset in three years, paying 30 percent taxes on any excess of the selling price over book value. The proposal indicates that a $647,500 terminal selling price will enable the company to earn a 15 percent internal rate of return on the investment. Bohm doubts that this terminal value estimate is correct.Another proposal concerns Gasup Company, which does natural gas exploration. A new investment has been identified by the Gasup finance department with the following projected cash flows:● Investment outlays are $6 million immediately and $1 million at the end of the first year.● After-tax operating cash flows are $0.5 million at the end of the first year and $4 million at the end of each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth years. In addition, an after-tax outflow occurs at the end of the five-year project that has not been included in the operating cash flows: $5 million required for environmental cleanup.● The required rate of return on natural gas exploration is 18 percent.The Gasup analyst is unsure about the calculation of the NPV and the IRR because the outlay is staged over two years.Finally, Dominion Company is evaluating two mutually exclusive projects: The Pinto grinder involves an outlay of $100,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $45,000, an after-tax salvage value of $25,000, and a three-year life. The Bolten grinder has an outlay of $125,000, annual after-tax operating cash flows of $47,000, an after-tax salvage value of $20,000, and a four-year life. The required rate of return is 10 percent. The net present value (NPV) and equivalent annual annuity (EAA) of the Pinto grinder are $30,691 and $12,341, respectively. Whichever grinder is chosen, it will have to be replaced at the end of its service life. The analyst is unsure about which grinder should be chosen.Bohm and his colleague Beth Goldberg have an extended conversation about capital budgeting issues, including several comments listed below. Goldberg makes two comments about real options:Comment 1“The abandonment option is valuable, but it should be exercised only when the abandonment value is above the amount of the original investment.”Comment 2“If the cost of a real option is less than its value, this will increase the NPV of the investment project in which the real option is embedded.”Bohm also makes several comments about specific projects under consideration:Comment AThe land and building were purchased five years ago for $10 million. This is the amount that should now be included in the fixed capital investment.”Comment B“We can improve the project's NPV by using the after-tax cost of debt as the discount rate. If we finance the project with 100 percent debt, this discount rate would be appropriate.”Comment C“It is generally safer to use the NPV than the IRR in making capital budgeting decisions. However, when evaluating mutually exclusive projects, if the projects have conventional cash flow patterns and have the same investment outlays, it is acceptable to use either the NPV or IRR.”Comment D“You should not base a capital budgeting decision on its immediate impact on earnings per share (EPS).”

The offer is to pay Sky Systems' shareholders the current market value of their stock in Modern Auto's stock. The relevant information it used in those calculations is given below:
| Modern Auto | Sky Systems |
| Share price | $40 | $25 |
| Number of outstanding shares(ml lions) | 40 | 15 |

Although the total earnings of the combined company will not increase and are estimated to be $130 million, Charles Wilhelm (treasurer of Modern Auto) argues that there are two attractive reasons to merge. First, Wilhelm says, “The merger of Modern Auto and Sky Systems will result in lower risk for our shareholders because of the diversification effect.” Second, Wilhelm also says, “If our EPS increases, our stock price will increase in line with the EPS increase because our P/E will stay the same.”Sky Systems managers are not interested in the offer by Modern Auto. The managers, instead, approach HiFly, Inc., which is in the same industry as Sky Systems, to see if it would be interested in acquiring Sky Systems. HiFly is interested, and both companies believe there will be synergies from this acquisition. If HiFly were to acquire Sky Systems, it would do so by paying $400 million in cash.

71,"Mark Zin and Stella Lee are CEO and CFO, respectively, of Moonbase Corporation. They are concerned that Moonbase is undervalued and subject to a hostile takeover bid. To assess the value of their own firm, they are reviewing current financial data for Jupiter PLC, Saturn Corporation, and Voyager Corporation, three firms they believe are comparable to Moonbase.
| Relative Valuation Ratio | Jupiter | Saturn | Voyager |
| P/E | 23.00 | 19.50 | 21.50 |
| P/B | 4.24 | 5.25 | 4.91 |
| P/CF | 12.60 | 11.40 | 13.30 |


Zin believes Moonbase should trade at similar multiples to these firms and that each valuation ratio measure is equally valid. Moonbase has a current stock price of $34.00 per share, earnings of $1.75 per share, book value of $8.50 per share, and cash flow of $3.20 per share. Using the average of each of the three multiples for the three comparable firms, Zin finds that Moonbase is undervalued.Lee states that the low valuation reflects current poor performance of a subsidiary of Moonbase. She recommends that the board of directors consider divesting the subsidiary in a manner that would provide cash inflow to Moonbase.Zin proposes that some action should be taken before a hostile takeover bid is made. He asks Lee if changes can be made to the corporate governance structure in order to make it more difficult for an unwanted suitor to succeed.In response, Lee makes two comments of actions that would make a hostile takeover more difficult. Lee's first comment is “Moonbase can institute a poison pill that allows our shareholders, other than the hostile bidder, to purchase shares at a substantial discount to current market value.” Lee's second comment is: “Moonbase can instead institute a poison put. The put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to current market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors with the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase governance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe characteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1: Moonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the firm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the board of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not employed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company and thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit committee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task, with an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is particularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate Governance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders, investment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special attention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These policies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the board and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment of the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided of directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management and compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a highly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an expanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an independent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship requirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the board of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or compensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that Steris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.

72,"Karen Maghami is a portfolio manager for a mutual fund. Maghami, working with analyst Marcel Lynbrock, is researching two companies: Syvie Electric and EnileGEN. Located in the same country, both companies produce electricity from conventional and renewable sources. Maghami wants to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the analysis of each company’s financial statements.Syvie Electric is a stock exchange- listed, state- owned enterprise (SOE). The sovereign government holds 58% of shares; remaining shares are publicly traded. EnileGEN is a public company owned primarily by institutional investors.Lynbrock starts with an analysis of corporate governance factors. Relevant information about the two companies is summarized in Exhibit 1.

| Percentage of shares owned by the largest shareholder | 58% | 9% |

| Percentage of directors with experience in industry | 27% | 88% |
| Remuneration Policies |  |
| Clawback policy | No | Yes |
| Say-on-pay provision | Yes | No |


After reviewing the corporate governance information, Maghami and Lynbrock focus on factors related to environmental and social considerations. Lynbrock asks Maghami, “What resource would you recommend using to find a list of ESG factors material to the electricity generation sector?”Next, Maghami and Lynbrock discuss the effect of expected regulatory changes on stock and bond values for both companies. The government recently announced that it intends to authorize a new environmental regulation requiring that a minimum of 35% of electricity be produced from renewable sources. ?The exact timing of the new regulation is unknown, but EnileGEN already exceeds the minimum level by a significant margin. Maghami notes that the new regulation should give EnileGEN a competitive edge in the industry, and for scenario analysis purposes, she asks Lynbrock to assume that the regulation will take effect in two years. Lynbrock uses a discounted cash flow model to value EnileGEN stock under the assumption requested by Maghami.Lynbrock believes that the new regulation will make three of Syvie Electric’s coal-fired power stations no longer financially viable within 10 years following implementation. Maghami asks Lynbrock to estimate the potential effect on Syvie Electric’s balance sheet and the potential impact on the value of Syvie Electric bonds.Maghami reads in Syvie Electric’s most recent financial statements that the company plans to issue green bonds. Maghami asks Lynbrock to evaluate any possible valuation risks or opportunities associated with green bonds. Lynbrock tells Maghami the following:Statement 1: Green bonds offer higher protection for an investor because they typically are backed by the income derived from the environmental project they are used to fund.Statement 2: Issuing green bonds ensures a lower cost of capital because the green feature typically results in a tighter credit spread compared with conventional bonds.Statement 3: A unique risk related to green bonds is greenwashing, which is the risk that the bond’s proceeds are not actually used for a beneficial environmental or climate-related project.
Based on Exhibit 1 and their ownership structures, market scrutiny of Syvie Electric’s management is most likely:",lower than EnileGEN.,the same as EnileGEN.,higher than EnileGEN.,,A

The put allows shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at a substantial premium to current market value.”Zin is also concerned about the general attitude of outside investors with the governance of Moonbase. He has read brokerage reports indicating that the Moonbase governance ratings are generally low. Zin believes the following statements describe characteristics that should provide Moonbase with a strong governance rating.Statement 1: Moonbase's directors obtain advice from the corporate counsel to aid them in assessing the firm's compliance with regulatory requirements.Statement 2: Five of the ten members of the board of directors are not employed by Moonbase and are considered independent. Though not employed by the company, two of the independent directors are former executives of the company and thus can contribute useful expertise relevant for the business.Statement 3: The audit committee of the board is organized so as to have sufficient resources to carry out its task, with an internal staff that reports routinely and directly to the audit committee.Zin is particularly proud of the fact that Moonbase has begun drafting a “Statement of Corporate Governance” (SCG) that will be available on the company website for viewing by shareholders, investment analysts, and any interested stakeholders. In particular, the SCG pays special attention to policies that ensure effective contributions from the board of directors. These policies include the following:Policy 1: Training is provided to directors prior to joining the board and periodically thereafter.Policy 2: Statements are provided of management's assessment of the board's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.Policy 3: Statements are provided of directors' responsibilities regarding oversight and monitoring of the firm's risk management and compliance functions.Zin concludes the discussion by announcing that Johann Steris, a highly regarded ex-CFO of a major corporation, is under consideration as a member of an expanded board of directors. Zin states that Steris meets all the requirements as an independent director including the fact that he will not violate the interlocking directorship requirement. Steris also will bring experience as a member of the compensation committee of the board of another firm. He also comments that Steris desires to serve on either the audit or compensation committee of the Moonbase board and that good governance practice suggests that Steris would not be prohibited from serving on either committee.
Which statement by Zin provides the most support for a strong governance rating?",Statement 1,Statement 2,Statement 3,,C
74,"Karen Maghami is a portfolio manager for a mutual fund. Maghami, working with analyst Marcel Lynbrock, is researching two companies: Syvie Electric and EnileGEN. Located in the same country, both companies produce electricity from conventional and renewable sources. Maghami wants to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into the analysis of each company’s financial statements.Syvie Electric is a stock exchange- listed, state- owned enterprise (SOE). The sovereign government holds 58% of shares; remaining shares are publicly traded. EnileGEN is a public company owned primarily by institutional investors.Lynbrock starts with an analysis of corporate governance factors. Relevant information about the two companies is summarized in Exhibit 1.

After reviewing the corporate governance information, Maghami and Lynbrock focus on factors related to environmental and social considerations. Lynbrock asks Maghami, “What resource would you recommend using to find a list of ESG factors material to the electricity generation sector?”Next, Maghami and Lynbrock discuss the effect of expected regulatory changes on stock and bond values for both companies. The government recently announced that it intends to authorize a new environmental regulation requiring that a minimum of 35% of electricity be produced from renewable sources. ?The exact timing of the new regulation is unknown, but EnileGEN already exceeds the minimum level by a significant margin. Maghami notes that the new regulation should give EnileGEN a competitive edge in the industry, and for scenario analysis purposes, she asks Lynbrock to assume that the regulation will take effect in two years. Lynbrock uses a discounted cash flow model to value EnileGEN stock under the assumption requested by Maghami.Lynbrock believes that the new regulation will make three of Syvie Electric’s coal-fired power stations no longer financially viable within 10 years following implementation. Maghami asks Lynbrock to estimate the potential effect on Syvie Electric’s balance sheet and the potential impact on the value of Syvie Electric bonds.Maghami reads in Syvie Electric’s most recent financial statements that the company plans to issue green bonds. Maghami asks Lynbrock to evaluate any possible valuation risks or opportunities associated with green bonds. Lynbrock tells Maghami the following:Statement 1: Green bonds offer higher protection for an investor because they typically are backed by the income derived from the environmental project they are used to fund.Statement 2: Issuing green bonds ensures a lower cost of capital because the green feature typically results in a tighter credit spread compared with conventional bonds.Statement 3: A unique risk related to green bonds is greenwashing, which is the risk that the bond’s proceeds are not actually used for a beneficial environmental or climate-related project.
Under the regulatory scenario requested by Maghami, Lynbrock should increase the credit spread of a Syvie Electric 10-year bond:",less than the spread of a 2-year bond.,by the same amount as the spread of a 2-year bond.,more than the spread of a 2-year bond.,,C
75,"Josh Logan is a buy-side equity analyst who follows Durtech. Logan's supervisor believes that Durtech is a likely takeover candidate and has asked Logan to estimate the company's value per share in the event of an “all stock” takeover bid. Logan plans to estimate Durtech's value per share using three approaches: discounted cash flow, comparable company analysis, and comparable transaction analysis.Durtech has 1.2 million common shares outstanding and no outstanding long-term debt or preferred stock. Logan estimates that Durtech's free cash flows at the end of the next three years will be $5.0 million, $6.0 million, and $7.0 million, respectively. After Year 3, he projects that free cash flow will grow at 5 percent per year. He determines the appropriate discount rate for this free cash flow stream is 15 percent per year.Applying discounted cash flow analysis to the preceding information, Logan determines that Durtech’s fair enterprise value is $61.8 million. In a separate analysis based on ratios, Logan estimates that at the end of the third year, Durtech will be worth 10 times its Year 3 free cash flow.Logan gathers data on two companies comparable to Durtech: Alphatech and Betatech. He believes that price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and price-to-book-value per share of these companies should be used to value Durtech. The relevant data for the three companies are given in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Valuation Variables for Dur tech and Comparable Companies |
| Valuation Variables | Alphatech | Beta tech | Dur tech |
| Current stock price(S) | 72.00 | 45.00 | 24.00 |
| Eam ings per share(S) | 2.00 | 1.50 | 1.00 |
| Sales per share(S) | 32.00 | 22.50 | 16.00 |
| Book value per share(S) | 18.00 | 10.00 | 8.00 |


Logan also identifies one recent takeover transaction and analyzes its takeover premium (the amount by which its takeover price per share exceeds its current stock price). Omegatech is comparable to the possible transaction on Durtech. Omegatech had a stock price of $44.40 per share prior to a newspaper report of a takeover rumor. After the takeover rumor was reported, the price rose immediately to $60.30 per share. Eventually, the takeover offer was accepted by Omegatech's shareholders for $55.00 per share. One-year trailing earnings per share for Omegatech immediately prior to the takeover were $1.25 per share.
Based upon the premium on a recent comparable transaction, Logan's best estimate of the takeover premium for Durtech is closest to:",19.9%.,23.9%.,35.8%.,,B

She wants to know the effect of a switch from straight-line to accelerated depreciation on the company's operating income and the project's NPV. She also believes that the initial outlay might be much smaller than initially assumed. Specifically, she thinks the outlay for fixed capital might be INR0.24 billion lower, with no change in salvage value.When reviewing her work, Simpson's supervisor provides the following comments. “I note that you are relying heavily on the NPV approach to valuing the investment decision. I don't think you should use an IRR because of the multiple IRR problem that is likely to arise with the Bayonne Pharma project. However, the equivalent annual annuity would be a more appropriate measure to use for the project than the NPV. I suggest that you compute an EAA.”

Hernández estimates that this project will increase the value of the company and, consequently, she plans on changing her research opinion on the company from a “hold” to a “buy.” Her initial financial predictions for the project are:● Fixed capital equipment outlay is €2,750,000.● At the beginning of the project, a required increase in current assets of €200,000 and a required increase in current liabilities of €125,000.● Straight-line depreciation to zero over a five-year life.● Project life of five years.● Incremental annual unit sales of 3,000 at a unit price of €600.● Annual fixed cash expenses of €125,000; variable cash expenses of €125 per unit.● The capital equipment is expected to be sold for €450,000 at the end of Year 5. At the end of the project, the net working capital investment will be recovered.● Tax rate of 40 percent.● Based on the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return is 12 percent.Hernández estimates the expected net present value (NPV) of the project to be €975,538 and the internal rate of return (IRR) to be 24.6 percent. She also performs a sensitivity analysis by changing the input variable assumptions used in her initial analysis.When reviewing Hernández's work, her supervisor, Arturo Costa, notes that she did not include changes in the depreciation method, initial fixed capital outlay, or inflation assumptions in her sensitivity analysis. As a result, Costa asks the following questions:Question 1“What would be the effect on the project's NPV if the initial fixed capital equipment outlay increased from €2,750,000 to €3,000,000, everything else held constant?”Question 2“How would a higher than expected inflation rate affect the value of the real tax savings from depreciation and the value of the real after-tax interest expense, everything else held constant?”Question 3“You are using a required rate of return of 12 percent when the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 10 percent. Why are you using a required rate of return for the project greater than the company's WACC?”Before ending the meeting, Costa tells Hernández: “Last year the company produced a prototype at a cost of €500,000. Now management is having doubts about the market appeal of the product in its current design, and so they are considering delaying the start of the project for a year, until the prototype can be shown to industry experts.”

If inflation is lower than expected, the value of the real tax savings from depreciation and the value of the real after-tax interest expense are both reduced.”Concept 2“Sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis are useful tools for estimating the impact on a project's NPV of changing the value of one capital budgeting input variable at a time.”Concept 3“When comparing two mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives, the IRR is a good approach for choosing the better project because it does not require equal lives.”Concept 4“Project-specific betas should be used instead of company betas whenever the risk of the project differs from that of the company.”Problem“Fontenot Company is investing €100 in a project that is being depreciated straight-line to zero over a two-year life with no salvage value. The project will generate earnings before interest and taxes of €50 each year for two years. Fontenot's weighted average cost of capital and required rate of return for the project are both 12 percent, and its tax rate is 30 percent.”
The market value added (MVA) in euros for the Fontenot Company is closest to:",38.87.,39.92.,43.65.,,C
