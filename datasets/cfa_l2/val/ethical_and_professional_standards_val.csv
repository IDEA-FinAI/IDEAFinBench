0,"Samuel Telline, CFA, is a portfolio manager at Aiklin Investments with discretionary authority over all of his accounts. One of his clients, Alan Caper, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ellipse Manufacturing, invites Telline to lunch.At the restaurant, the CEO reveals the reason for the lunch. “As you know Reinhold Partners has made an unsolicited cash offer for all outstanding shares of Ellipse Manufacturing. Reinhold has made it clear that I will not be CEO if they are successful. I can assure you that our shareholders will be better off in the long term if I'm in charge.” Caper then shows Telline his projections for a new plan designed to boost both sales and operating margins.“I know that your firm is the trustee for our firm's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). I hope that the trustee will vote in the best interest of our shareholders—and that would be a vote against the takeover offer.”After looking through Caper's business plans, Telline says, “This plan looks good. I will recommend that the trustee vote against the offer.”Caper responds, “I remember my friend Karen Leighton telling me that the Leighton Family's Trust is managed by your firm. Perhaps the trustee could vote those shares against the acquisition as well. Karen Leighton is a close friend. I am sure that she would agree.”Telline responds, “The Family Trust is no longer managed by Aiklin.” He adds, “I understand that the Trust is very conservatively managed. I doubt it that it would have holdings in Ellipse Manufacturing.” Telline does not mention that although the Family Trust has changed investment managers, Karen Leighton remains an important client at Aiklin with significant personal holdings in Ellipse.After lunch, Telline meets with Sydney Brown, CFA, trustee of the Ellipse ESOP. He shows her Caper's plan for improvements. “I think the plan is a good one and Caper is one of the firm's most profitable accounts. We don't want to lose him.” Brown agrees to analyze the plan. After thoroughly analyzing both the plan and the takeover offer, Brown concludes that the takeover offer is best for the shareholders in the ESOP and votes the plan's shares in favor of the takeover offer.A few months later the acquisition of Ellipse by Reinhold Partners is completed. Caper again meets Telline for lunch. “I received a generous severance package and I'm counting on you to manage my money well for me. While we are on the subject, I would like to be more aggressive with my portfolio. With my severance package, I can take additional risk.” Telline and Caper discuss his current financial situation, risk tolerance, and financial objectives throughout lunch. Telline agrees to adjust Caper's investment policy statement (IPS) to reflect his greater appetite for risk and his increased wealth.Back at the office, Telline realizes that with the severance package, Caper is now his wealthiest client. He also realizes that Caper's increased appetite for risk gives him a risk profile similar to that of another client. He pulls a copy of the other client's investment policy statement (IPS) and reviews it quickly before realizing that the two clients have very different tax situations. Telline quickly revises Caper's IPS to reflect the changes in his financial situation. He uses the other client's IPS as a reference when revising the section relating to Caper's risk tolerance. He then files the revised IPS in Caper's file.The following week, an Aiklin analyst issues a buy recommendation on a small technology company with a promising software product. Telline reads the report carefully and concludes it would be suitable under Caper's new IPS. Telline places an order for 10,000 shares in Caper's account and then calls Caper to discuss the stock in more detail. Telline does not purchase the stock for any other clients. Although the one client has the same risk profile as Caper, that client does not have cash available in his account and Telline determines that selling existing holdings does not make sense.In a subsequent telephone conversation, Caper expresses his lingering anger over the takeover. “You didn't do enough to persuade Aiklin's clients to vote against the takeover. Maybe I should look for an investment manager who is more loyal.” Telline tries to calm Caper but is unsuccessful. In an attempt to change the topic of conversation, Telline states, “The firm was just notified of our allocation of a long-awaited IPO. Your account should receive a significant allocation. I would hate to see you lose out by moving your account.” Caper seems mollified and concludes the phone call, “I look forward to a long-term relationship with you and your firm.”Aiklin distributes a copy of its firm policies regarding IPO allocations to all clients annually. According to the policy, Aiklin allocates IPO shares to each investment manager and each manager has responsibility for allocating shares to accounts for which the IPO is suitable. The statement also discloses that Aiklin offers different levels of service for different fees.After carefully reviewing the proposed IPO and his client accounts, Telline determines that the IPO is suitable for 11 clients including Caper. Because the deal is oversubscribed, he receives only half of the shares he expected. Telline directs 50% of his allocation to Caper's account and divides the remaining 50% between the other ten accounts, each with a value equal to half of Caper's account.
Is Aiklin's policy with respect to IPO allocations consistent with required and recommended CFA Institute Standards?",Yes.,"No, because the IPO policy disadvantages certain clients.","No, because the different levels of service disadvantage certain clients.",,B

2,"Adam Craw, CFA, is chief executive officer (CEO) of Crawfood, a European private equity firm specializing in food retailers. The retail food industry has been consolidating during the past two years as private equity funds have closed numerous deals and taken many companies private.Crawfood recently hired Lillian Voser, a CFA Level II candidate, as a controller. On Voser's first day of work, the head of personnel informs her that by signing the employment contract, Voser agrees to comply with the company's code of ethics and compliance manual. She hands Voser copies of the code and compliance manual without further comment. Voser spends the next hour reading both documents. An excerpt from the compliance manual appears in Exhibit 1.

| 1. | Employees must | notaccept gifts， benefits， compensation， or consideration that |

When she enters her new office that afternoon, Voser finds a large gift basket sent by her sister. The card reads “Congratulations on your new position.” The basket is filled with expensive high-quality food items from Greenhornfood—a local small, publicly-traded food retailer, which produces many delicatessen products under its own brand name.During the next two weeks, Voser meets with all of Crawfood's upper management, including the CEO. In his office, Craw praises Voser's efforts to complete the CFA program. “The program is demanding, but it is worthwhile.” Craw then explains his investment strategy for choosing Crawfood's acquisition targets. He points to a large map on the wall with multi-colored pins marking Crawfood's previous takeovers. The map shows acquisitions in all the major cities of Germany with one exception—the home of Crawfood headquarters. Craw remarks, “We are currently in talks for another purchase. Confidentiality prohibits me from discussing it any further, but you will hear more about it soon.”Introduced to Greenhornfood by her sister, Voser quickly becomes a loyal customer. She considers it the best food retailer in the vicinity and she frequently purchases its products.The following week, the local newspaper features an article about Greenhornfood and its young founders. The article describes the company's loyal and growing customer base as well as its poor quarterly financial results. Voser notes that the stock has steadily declined during the past twelve months. She concludes that the company has an inexperienced management team, but its popular product line and loyal customer base make the company a potential acquisition target. Voser calls her sister and recommends that she purchase Greenhornfood shares because “it would be an attractive acquisition for a larger company.” Based on Voser's recommendation, her sister buys €3,000 worth of shares.During the following two weeks the stock price of Greenhornfood continues to decline. Voser's sister is uncertain of what she should do with her position. She seeks Voser's advice. Voser recommends that her sister wait another few days before making her decision and promises to analyze the situation in the meantime.While walking by Craw's office the following day, Voser sees a document with Greenhornfood's distinctive logo and overhears the company's name through an open office door. That evening, Voser tells her sister, “with the price decline, the stock is even more attractive.” She recommends that her sister increase her position. Based on her recommendation her sister buys an additional €3,000 worth of Greenhornfood shares.One month later, Crawfood publicly announces the acquisition of Greenhornfood Company at a 20% premium to the previous day's closing price. Following the announcement, Voser's sister boasts about Voser's excellent recommendation and timing to her broker.Regulatory authorities initiate an investigation into suspicious trading in Greenhornfood shares and options preceding the formal announcement of the acquisition. Craw receives a letter from regulatory authorities stating that he is the subject of a formal investigation into his professional conduct surrounding the acquisition. He learns from the compliance officer that Voser is also under investigation. The compliance officer provides no details and out of respect for Voser's privacy, Craw makes no inquiries.The situation remains unchanged and the matter is still pending with regulatory authorities several months later when Craw receives his annual Professional Conduct Statement (PCS) from CFA Institute. He reviews the text asking “In the last two years, have you been . . . the subject of…any investigation…in which your professional conduct, in either a direct or supervisory capacity, was at issue?”

A new independent rating service has determined that Zardt's recommendations have resulted in an excess return of 12% versus the industry's return of 2.7% for the past twelve months. After learning about the rating service, Zardt immediately updates the promotional material he is preparing for distribution at an upcoming industry conference. He includes a reference to the rating service and quotes its returns results and other information. Before distributing the material at the conference, he adds a footnote stating “Past performance is no guarantee of future success.”
When removing the multi-factor analysis from his research report, does Grohl violate any CFA Standards?",No.,"Yes, because he no longer has a reasonable basis for his recommendation.","Yes, because he is required to make full and fair disclosure of all relevant information.",,A
8,"Adam Craw, CFA, is chief executive officer (CEO) of Crawfood, a European private equity firm specializing in food retailers. The retail food industry has been consolidating during the past two years as private equity funds have closed numerous deals and taken many companies private.Crawfood recently hired Lillian Voser, a CFA Level II candidate, as a controller. On Voser's first day of work, the head of personnel informs her that by signing the employment contract, Voser agrees to comply with the company's code of ethics and compliance manual. She hands Voser copies of the code and compliance manual without further comment. Voser spends the next hour reading both documents. An excerpt from the compliance manual appears in Exhibit 1.

When she enters her new office that afternoon, Voser finds a large gift basket sent by her sister. The card reads “Congratulations on your new position.” The basket is filled with expensive high-quality food items from Greenhornfood—a local small, publicly-traded food retailer, which produces many delicatessen products under its own brand name.During the next two weeks, Voser meets with all of Crawfood's upper management, including the CEO. In his office, Craw praises Voser's efforts to complete the CFA program. “The program is demanding, but it is worthwhile.” Craw then explains his investment strategy for choosing Crawfood's acquisition targets. He points to a large map on the wall with multi-colored pins marking Crawfood's previous takeovers. The map shows acquisitions in all the major cities of Germany with one exception—the home of Crawfood headquarters. Craw remarks, “We are currently in talks for another purchase. Confidentiality prohibits me from discussing it any further, but you will hear more about it soon.”Introduced to Greenhornfood by her sister, Voser quickly becomes a loyal customer. She considers it the best food retailer in the vicinity and she frequently purchases its products.The following week, the local newspaper features an article about Greenhornfood and its young founders. The article describes the company's loyal and growing customer base as well as its poor quarterly financial results. Voser notes that the stock has steadily declined during the past twelve months. She concludes that the company has an inexperienced management team, but its popular product line and loyal customer base make the company a potential acquisition target. Voser calls her sister and recommends that she purchase Greenhornfood shares because “it would be an attractive acquisition for a larger company.” Based on Voser's recommendation, her sister buys €3,000 worth of shares.During the following two weeks the stock price of Greenhornfood continues to decline. Voser's sister is uncertain of what she should do with her position. She seeks Voser's advice. Voser recommends that her sister wait another few days before making her decision and promises to analyze the situation in the meantime.While walking by Craw's office the following day, Voser sees a document with Greenhornfood's distinctive logo and overhears the company's name through an open office door. That evening, Voser tells her sister, “with the price decline, the stock is even more attractive.” She recommends that her sister increase her position. Based on her recommendation her sister buys an additional €3,000 worth of Greenhornfood shares.One month later, Crawfood publicly announces the acquisition of Greenhornfood Company at a 20% premium to the previous day's closing price. Following the announcement, Voser's sister boasts about Voser's excellent recommendation and timing to her broker.Regulatory authorities initiate an investigation into suspicious trading in Greenhornfood shares and options preceding the formal announcement of the acquisition. Craw receives a letter from regulatory authorities stating that he is the subject of a formal investigation into his professional conduct surrounding the acquisition. He learns from the compliance officer that Voser is also under investigation. The compliance officer provides no details and out of respect for Voser's privacy, Craw makes no inquiries.The situation remains unchanged and the matter is still pending with regulatory authorities several months later when Craw receives his annual Professional Conduct Statement (PCS) from CFA Institute. He reviews the text asking “In the last two years, have you been . . . the subject of…any investigation…in which your professional conduct, in either a direct or supervisory capacity, was at issue?”
According to the CFA Institute Standards, must Voser obtain permission from her supervisor before accepting the Greenhornfood gift basket?",No.,"Yes, because the value of the basket is higher than €50.","Yes, because consent is required by the company's compliance procedures.",,A
9,"Samuel Telline, CFA, is a portfolio manager at Aiklin Investments with discretionary authority over all of his accounts. One of his clients, Alan Caper, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ellipse Manufacturing, invites Telline to lunch.At the restaurant, the CEO reveals the reason for the lunch. “As you know Reinhold Partners has made an unsolicited cash offer for all outstanding shares of Ellipse Manufacturing. Reinhold has made it clear that I will not be CEO if they are successful. I can assure you that our shareholders will be better off in the long term if I'm in charge.” Caper then shows Telline his projections for a new plan designed to boost both sales and operating margins.“I know that your firm is the trustee for our firm's Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). I hope that the trustee will vote in the best interest of our shareholders—and that would be a vote against the takeover offer.”After looking through Caper's business plans, Telline says, “This plan looks good. I will recommend that the trustee vote against the offer.”Caper responds, “I remember my friend Karen Leighton telling me that the Leighton Family's Trust is managed by your firm. Perhaps the trustee could vote those shares against the acquisition as well. Karen Leighton is a close friend. I am sure that she would agree.”Telline responds, “The Family Trust is no longer managed by Aiklin.” He adds, “I understand that the Trust is very conservatively managed. I doubt it that it would have holdings in Ellipse Manufacturing.” Telline does not mention that although the Family Trust has changed investment managers, Karen Leighton remains an important client at Aiklin with significant personal holdings in Ellipse.After lunch, Telline meets with Sydney Brown, CFA, trustee of the Ellipse ESOP. He shows her Caper's plan for improvements. “I think the plan is a good one and Caper is one of the firm's most profitable accounts. We don't want to lose him.” Brown agrees to analyze the plan. After thoroughly analyzing both the plan and the takeover offer, Brown concludes that the takeover offer is best for the shareholders in the ESOP and votes the plan's shares in favor of the takeover offer.A few months later the acquisition of Ellipse by Reinhold Partners is completed. Caper again meets Telline for lunch. “I received a generous severance package and I'm counting on you to manage my money well for me. While we are on the subject, I would like to be more aggressive with my portfolio. With my severance package, I can take additional risk.” Telline and Caper discuss his current financial situation, risk tolerance, and financial objectives throughout lunch. Telline agrees to adjust Caper's investment policy statement (IPS) to reflect his greater appetite for risk and his increased wealth.Back at the office, Telline realizes that with the severance package, Caper is now his wealthiest client. He also realizes that Caper's increased appetite for risk gives him a risk profile similar to that of another client. He pulls a copy of the other client's investment policy statement (IPS) and reviews it quickly before realizing that the two clients have very different tax situations. Telline quickly revises Caper's IPS to reflect the changes in his financial situation. He uses the other client's IPS as a reference when revising the section relating to Caper's risk tolerance. He then files the revised IPS in Caper's file.The following week, an Aiklin analyst issues a buy recommendation on a small technology company with a promising software product. Telline reads the report carefully and concludes it would be suitable under Caper's new IPS. Telline places an order for 10,000 shares in Caper's account and then calls Caper to discuss the stock in more detail. Telline does not purchase the stock for any other clients. Although the one client has the same risk profile as Caper, that client does not have cash available in his account and Telline determines that selling existing holdings does not make sense.In a subsequent telephone conversation, Caper expresses his lingering anger over the takeover. “You didn't do enough to persuade Aiklin's clients to vote against the takeover. Maybe I should look for an investment manager who is more loyal.” Telline tries to calm Caper but is unsuccessful. In an attempt to change the topic of conversation, Telline states, “The firm was just notified of our allocation of a long-awaited IPO. Your account should receive a significant allocation. I would hate to see you lose out by moving your account.” Caper seems mollified and concludes the phone call, “I look forward to a long-term relationship with you and your firm.”Aiklin distributes a copy of its firm policies regarding IPO allocations to all clients annually. According to the policy, Aiklin allocates IPO shares to each investment manager and each manager has responsibility for allocating shares to accounts for which the IPO is suitable. The statement also discloses that Aiklin offers different levels of service for different fees.After carefully reviewing the proposed IPO and his client accounts, Telline determines that the IPO is suitable for 11 clients including Caper. Because the deal is oversubscribed, he receives only half of the shares he expected. Telline directs 50% of his allocation to Caper's account and divides the remaining 50% between the other ten accounts, each with a value equal to half of Caper's account.
The Standard least likely to provide guidance for Telline when working with the clients' investment policy statements would be the Standard relating to:",suitability.,fair dealing.,"loyalty, prudence, and care.",,B
