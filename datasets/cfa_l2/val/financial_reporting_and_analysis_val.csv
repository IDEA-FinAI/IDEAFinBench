In the report, Yoo discusses the relative global systemic risk across industries, referencing Industry A (international property and casualty insurance), Industry B (credit unions), and Industry C (global commercial banks). Part of Yoo’s analysis focuses on Company XYZ, a global commercial bank, and its CAMELS rating, risk management practices, and performance. First, Yoo considers the firm’s capital adequacy as measured by the key capital ratios (common equity Tier 1 capital, total Tier 1 capital, and total capital) in Exhibit 1.

Dodd meets with Sonya Webster, the firm's analyst responsible for the machinery industry, to discuss three established companies: BIG Industrial, Construction Supply, and Dynamic Production. Webster provides Dodd with research notes for each company that reflect trends during the last three years:BIG Industrial: Note 1 Operating income has been much lower than operating cash flow (OCF).Note 2 Accounts payable has increased, while accounts receivable and inventory have substantially decreased.Note 3 Although OCF was positive, it was just sufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Construction Supply: Note 4 Operating margins have been relatively constant.Note 5 The growth rate in revenue has exceeded the growth rate in receivables.Note 6 OCF was stable and positive, close to its reported net income, and just sufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Dynamic Production: Note 7 OCF has been more volatile than that of other industry participants.Note 8 OCF has fallen short of covering capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments. Dodd asks Webster about the use of quantitative tools to assess the likelihood of misreporting. Webster tells Dodd she uses the Beneish model, and she presents the estimated M-scores for each company in Exhibit 1.

| Dynamic Production | -1.86 | -1.12 | -0.74 |


Webster tells Dodd that Dynamic Production was required to restate its 2016 financial statements as a result of its attempt to inflate sales revenue. Customers of Dynamic Production were encouraged to take excess product in 2016, and they were then allowed to return purchases in the subsequent period, without penalty. Webster's industry analysis leads her to believe that innovations have caused some of the BIG Industrial's inventory to become obsolete. Webster expresses concern to Dodd that although the notes to the financial statements for BIG Industrial are informative about its inventory cost methods, its inventory is overstated. The BIG Industrial income statement reflects a profitable 49% unconsolidated equity investment. Webster calculates the return on sales of BIG Industrial based on the reported income statement. Dodd notes that industry peers consolidate similar investments. Dodd asks Webster to use a comparable method of calculating the return on sales for BIG Industrial.

6,"Mike Martinez is an equity analyst who has been asked to analyze Stellar, Inc. by his supervisor, Dominic Anderson. Stellar exhibited strong earnings growth last year; however, Anderson is skeptical about the sustainability of the company's earnings. He wants Martinez to focus on Stellar's financial reporting quality and earnings quality. After conducting a thorough review of the company's financial statements, Martinez concludes the following: ● Conclusion 1 Although Stellar's financial statements adhere to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Stellar understates earnings in periods when the company is performing well and overstates earnings in periods when the company is struggling. ● Conclusion 2 Stellar most likely understated the value of amortizable intangibles when recording the acquisition of Solar, Inc. last year. No goodwill impairment charges have been taken since the acquisition. ● Conclusion 3 Over time, the accruals component of Stellar's earnings is large relative to the cash component. ● Conclusion 4 Stellar reported an unusually sharp decline in accounts receivable in the current year, and an increase in long-term trade receivables.

On 31 December 2018, NinMount paid ￡320 million to purchase a 50 percent stake in Boswell Company. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Boswell's net assets was attributable to previously unrecorded licenses. These licenses were estimated to have an economic life of six years. The fair value of Boswell's assets and liabilities other than licenses was equal to their recorded book values. NinMount and Boswell both use the pound sterling as their reporting currency and prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRS.Byron is concerned whether the investment should affect his “buy” rating on NinMount common stock. He knows NinMount could choose one of several accounting methods to report the results of its investment, but NinMount has not announced which method it will use. Byron forecasts that both companies' 2019 financial results (excluding any merger accounting adjustments) will be identical to those of 2018.NinMount's and Boswell's condensed income statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, and condensed balance sheets at 31 December 2018, are presented in Exhibits 1 and 2, respectively.

All of the national banks under consideration primarily make long-term loans and source a significant portion of their funding from retail deposits. Paulinic and the rest of the research team note that the central bank is unwinding a long period of monetary easing as evidenced by two recent increases in the overnight funding rate.

13,"Zimt, AG is a consumer products manufacturer headquartered in Austria. It complies with IFRS. In 2009, Zimt held a 10 percent passive stake in Oxbow Limited that was classified as held for trading securities. During the year, the value of this stake declined by €3 million. In December 2009, Zimt announced that it would be increasing its ownership to 50 percent effective 1 January 2010.Franz Gelblum, an analyst following both Zimt and Oxbow, is curious how the increased stake will affect Zimt's consolidated financial statements. Because Gelblum is uncertain how the company will account for the increased stake, he uses his existing forecasts for both companies' financial statements to compare various alternative outcomes.Gelblum gathers abbreviated financial statement data for Zimt (Exhibit 1) and Oxbow (Exhibit 2) for this purpose.

16,"Adrienne Yu is an analyst with an international bank. She analyzes Ambleu S.A. (“Ambleu”), a multinational corporation, for a client presentation. Ambleu complies with IFRS, and its presentation currency is the Norvoltian krone (NVK). Ambleu's two subsidiaries, Ngcorp and Cendaró, have different functional currencies: Ngcorp uses the Bindiar franc (FB) and Cendaró uses the Crenland guinea (CRG). Yu first analyzes the following three transactions to assess foreign currency transaction exposure: Transaction 1: Cendaró sells goods to a non-domestic customer that pays in dollars on the purchase date. Transaction 2: Ngcorp obtains a loan in Bindiar francs on 1 June 2016 from a European bank with the Norvoltian krone as its presentation currency. Transaction 3: Ambleu imports inventory from Bindiar under 45-day credit terms, and the payment is to be denominated in Bindiar francs. Yu then reviews Transactions 2 and 3. She determines the method that Ambleu would use to translate Transaction 2 into its 31 December 2016 consolidated financial statements. While analyzing Transaction 3, Yu notes that Ambleu purchased inventory on 1 June 2016 for FB27,000/ton. Ambleu pays for the inventory on 15 July 2016.

17,"Pedro Ruiz is an analyst for a credit rating agency. One of the companies he follows, Eurexim SA, is based in France and complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Ruiz has learned that Eurexim used EUR220 million of its own cash and borrowed an equal amount to open a subsidiary in Ukraine. The funds were converted into hryvnia (UAH) on 31 December 20X1 at an exchange rate of EUR1.00 = UAH6.70 and used to purchase UAH1,500 million in fixed assets and UAH300 of inventories.Ruiz is concerned about the effect that the subsidiary's results might have on Eurexim's consolidated financial statements. He calls Eurexim's Chief Financial Officer, but learns little. Eurexim is not willing to share sales forecasts and has not even made a determination as to the subsidiary's functional currency.Absent more useful information, Ruiz decides to explore various scenarios to determine the potential impact on Eurexim's consolidated financial statements. Ukraine is not currently in a hyperinflationary environment, but Ruiz is concerned that this situation could change. Ruiz also believes the euro will appreciate against the hryvnia for the foreseeable future.
If Ukraine's economy becomes highly inflationary, Eurexim will most likely translate inventory by:",restating for inflation and using the temporal method.,restating for inflation and using the current exchange rate.,using the temporal method with no restatement for inflation.,,B
18,"Emmitt Dodd is a portfolio manager for Upsilon Advisers. Dodd meets with Sonya Webster, the firm's analyst responsible for the machinery industry, to discuss three established companies: BIG Industrial, Construction Supply, and Dynamic Production. Webster provides Dodd with research notes for each company that reflect trends during the last three years:BIG Industrial: Note 1 Operating income has been much lower than operating cash flow (OCF).Note 2 Accounts payable has increased, while accounts receivable and inventory have substantially decreased.Note 3 Although OCF was positive, it was just sufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Construction Supply: Note 4 Operating margins have been relatively constant.Note 5 The growth rate in revenue has exceeded the growth rate in receivables.Note 6 OCF was stable and positive, close to its reported net income, and just sufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Dynamic Production: Note 7 OCF has been more volatile than that of other industry participants.Note 8 OCF has fallen short of covering capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments. Dodd asks Webster about the use of quantitative tools to assess the likelihood of misreporting. Webster tells Dodd she uses the Beneish model, and she presents the estimated M-scores for each company in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Be neish Model M-scores |
| Company | 2017 | 2016 | Change in M-score |
| BIG Industrial | -1.54 | -1.82 | 0.28 |
| Construction Supply | -2.60 | -2.51 | -0.09 |
| Dynamic Production | -1.86 | -1.12 | -0.74 |


Webster tells Dodd that Dynamic Production was required to restate its 2016 financial statements as a result of its attempt to inflate sales revenue. Customers of Dynamic Production were encouraged to take excess product in 2016, and they were then allowed to return purchases in the subsequent period, without penalty. Webster's industry analysis leads her to believe that innovations have caused some of the BIG Industrial's inventory to become obsolete. Webster expresses concern to Dodd that although the notes to the financial statements for BIG Industrial are informative about its inventory cost methods, its inventory is overstated. The BIG Industrial income statement reflects a profitable 49% unconsolidated equity investment. Webster calculates the return on sales of BIG Industrial based on the reported income statement. Dodd notes that industry peers consolidate similar investments. Dodd asks Webster to use a comparable method of calculating the return on sales for BIG Industrial.
In response to Dodd's request, Webster's recalculated return on sales will most likely:",decrease.,remain the same.,increase.,,A

20,"Quentin Abay, CFA, is an analyst for a private equity firm interested in purchasing Bickchip Enterprises, a conglomerate. His first task is to determine the trends in ROE and the main drivers of the trends using DuPont analysis. To do so he gathers the data in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Selected Financial Data for Bick chip Enterprises(e Thousands) |
| 2009 | 2008 | 2007 |

| Asset turnover | 0.79 | 0.76 | 0.68 |
| Assets/Equity | 3.09 | 3.38 | 3.43 |


After conducting the DuPont analysis, Abay believes that his firm could increase the ROE without operational changes. Further, Abay thinks that ROE could improve if the company divested segments that were generating the lowest returns on capital employed (total assets less non-interest-bearing liabilities). Segment EBIT margins in 2009 were 11 percent for Automation Equipment, 5 percent for Power and Industrial, and 8 percent for Medical Equipment. Other relevant segment information is presented in Exhibit 2.

| 49，380 | 42，564 | 40，334 | 2，508 | 2，416 | 1，999 |


Abay is also concerned with earnings quality, so he intends to calculate Bickchip's cash-flow-based accruals ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow before interest and taxes to operating income. To do so, he prepares the information in Exhibit 3.
| Exhibit 3.Earnings Quality Data for Bick chip Enterprises(E Thousands) |

Based on the ratios for operating cash flow before interest and taxes to operating income, Abay should conclude that:",Bickchip's earnings are backed by cash flow.,ickchip's earnings are not backed by cash flow.,Abay can draw no conclusion due to the changes in the ratios over time.,,A

23,"Adrienne Yu is an analyst with an international bank. She analyzes Ambleu S.A. (“Ambleu”), a multinational corporation, for a client presentation. Ambleu complies with IFRS, and its presentation currency is the Norvoltian krone (NVK). Ambleu's two subsidiaries, Ngcorp and Cendaró, have different functional currencies: Ngcorp uses the Bindiar franc (FB) and Cendaró uses the Crenland guinea (CRG). Yu first analyzes the following three transactions to assess foreign currency transaction exposure: Transaction 1: Cendaró sells goods to a non-domestic customer that pays in dollars on the purchase date. Transaction 2: Ngcorp obtains a loan in Bindiar francs on 1 June 2016 from a European bank with the Norvoltian krone as its presentation currency. Transaction 3: Ambleu imports inventory from Bindiar under 45-day credit terms, and the payment is to be denominated in Bindiar francs. Yu then reviews Transactions 2 and 3. She determines the method that Ambleu would use to translate Transaction 2 into its 31 December 2016 consolidated financial statements. While analyzing Transaction 3, Yu notes that Ambleu purchased inventory on 1 June 2016 for FB27,000/ton. Ambleu pays for the inventory on 15 July 2016. Exhibit 1 presents selected economic data for Bindiar and Crenland.

Prior to reviewing the 2016 and 2017 consolidated financial statements of Ambleu, Yu meets with her supervisor, who asks Yu the following two questions: Question 1 Would a foreign currency translation loss reduce Ambleu's net sales growth? Question 2 According to IFRS, what disclosures should be included relating to Ambleu's treatment of foreign currency translation for Ngcorp? To complete her assignment, Yu analyzes selected information and notes from Ambleu's 2016 and 2017 consolidated financial statements, presented in Exhibit 2.

It was created on 31 December 20X1, and Consolidated Motors determined at that time that it should use the US dollar as its functional currency. Chief Financial Officer Monica Templeton was asked to explain to the board of directors how exchange rates affect the financial statements of both Consol-Can and the consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Motors. For the presentation, Templeton collects Consol-Can's balance sheets for the years ended 20X1 and 20X2 (Exhibit 1), as well as relevant exchange rate information (Exhibit 2).

Templeton explains that Consol-Can uses the FIFO inventory accounting method and that purchases of C$300 million and the sell-through of that inventory occurred evenly throughout 20X2. Her presentation includes reporting the translated amounts in US dollars for each item, as well as associated translation-related gains and losses. The board responds with several questions. ● Would there be a reason to change the functional currency to the Canadian dollar? ● Would there be any translation effects for Consolidated Motors if the functional currency for Consol-Can were changed to the Canadian dollar? ● Would a change in the functional currency have any impact on financial statement ratios for the parent company? ● What would be the balance sheet exposure to translation effects if the functional currency were changed?

He is preparing a research report on Topmaker, Inc., a publicly traded company that complies with IFRS.On 1 January 2016, Topmaker invested $11 million in Blanca Co. debt securities (with a 5.0% stated coupon on par value, and interest payable each 31 December). The par value of the securities is $10 million, and the market interest rate in effect when the bonds were purchased was 4.0%. Topmaker designates the investment as held to maturity. As of 31 December 2016, the fair value of the securities is $12 million.Blanca Co. wants to raise $40 million in capital by borrowing against its financial receivables. Blanca plans to create a special-purpose entity (SPE), invest $10 million in the SPE, have the SPE borrow $40 million, and then use the funds to purchase $50 million of receivables from Blanca. Blanca meets the definition of control and plans to consolidate the SPE. Blanca's balance sheet is presented in Exhibit 1.

Also on 1 January 2016, Topmaker acquired a 15% equity interest with voting power in Rainer Co. for $300 million. Topmaker has representation on Rainer's board of directors and participates in Rainer's policymaking process. Thronen believes that Topmaker underestimated the goodwill and balance sheet value of its investment account in Rainer. To estimate these figures, Thronen gathers selected financial information for Rainer as of 31 December 2016 in Exhibit 2. The plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis and have 10 years of remaining life.

Finally, Topmaker announces its plan to increase its ownership interest in Rainer to 80% effective 1 January 2018. It will account for the investment in Rainer using the partial goodwill method.

Stellar exhibited strong earnings growth last year; however, Anderson is skeptical about the sustainability of the company's earnings. He wants Martinez to focus on Stellar's financial reporting quality and earnings quality. After conducting a thorough review of the company's financial statements, Martinez concludes the following: ● Conclusion 1 Although Stellar's financial statements adhere to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Stellar understates earnings in periods when the company is performing well and overstates earnings in periods when the company is struggling. ● Conclusion 2 Stellar most likely understated the value of amortizable intangibles when recording the acquisition of Solar, Inc. last year. No goodwill impairment charges have been taken since the acquisition. ● Conclusion 3 Over time, the accruals component of Stellar's earnings is large relative to the cash component. ● Conclusion 4 Stellar reported an unusually sharp decline in accounts receivable in the current year, and an increase in long-term trade receivables.

Ruiz has learned that Eurexim used EUR220 million of its own cash and borrowed an equal amount to open a subsidiary in Ukraine. The funds were converted into hryvnia (UAH) on 31 December 20X1 at an exchange rate of EUR1.00 = UAH6.70 and used to purchase UAH1,500 million in fixed assets and UAH300 of inventories.Ruiz is concerned about the effect that the subsidiary's results might have on Eurexim's consolidated financial statements.

Dodd meets with Sonya Webster, the firm's analyst responsible for the machinery industry, to discuss three established companies: BIG Industrial, Construction Supply, and Dynamic Production. Webster provides Dodd with research notes for each company that reflect trends during the last three years:BIG Industrial: Note 1 Operating income has been much lower than operating cash flow (OCF).Note 2 Accounts payable has increased, while accounts receivable and inventory have substantially decreased.Note 3 Although OCF was positive, it was just sufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Construction Supply: Note 4 Operating margins have been relatively constant.Note 5 The growth rate in revenue has exceeded the growth rate in receivables.Note 6 OCF was stable and positive, close to its reported net income, and just sufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Dynamic Production: Note 7 OCF has been more volatile than that of other industry participants.Note 8 OCF has fallen short of covering capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments. Dodd asks Webster about the use of quantitative tools to assess the likelihood of misreporting. Webster tells Dodd she uses the Beneish model, and she presents the estimated M-scores for each company in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Be neish Model M-scores |
| Company | 2017 | 2016 | Change in M-score |

| Dynamic Production | -1.86 | -1.12 | -0.74 |


Webster tells Dodd that Dynamic Production was required to restate its 2016 financial statements as a result of its attempt to inflate sales revenue. Customers of Dynamic Production were encouraged to take excess product in 2016, and they were then allowed to return purchases in the subsequent period, without penalty. Webster's industry analysis leads her to believe that innovations have caused some of the BIG Industrial's inventory to become obsolete. Webster expresses concern to Dodd that although the notes to the financial statements for BIG Industrial are informative about its inventory cost methods, its inventory is overstated. The BIG Industrial income statement reflects a profitable 49% unconsolidated equity investment. Webster calculates the return on sales of BIG Industrial based on the reported income statement. Dodd notes that industry peers consolidate similar investments. Dodd asks Webster to use a comparable method of calculating the return on sales for BIG Industrial.

Ambleu complies with IFRS, and its presentation currency is the Norvoltian krone (NVK). Ambleu's two subsidiaries, Ngcorp and Cendaró, have different functional currencies: Ngcorp uses the Bindiar franc (FB) and Cendaró uses the Crenland guinea (CRG). Yu first analyzes the following three transactions to assess foreign currency transaction exposure: Transaction 1: Cendaró sells goods to a non-domestic customer that pays in dollars on the purchase date. Transaction 2: Ngcorp obtains a loan in Bindiar francs on 1 June 2016 from a European bank with the Norvoltian krone as its presentation currency. Transaction 3: Ambleu imports inventory from Bindiar under 45-day credit terms, and the payment is to be denominated in Bindiar francs. Yu then reviews Transactions 2 and 3. She determines the method that Ambleu would use to translate Transaction 2 into its 31 December 2016 consolidated financial statements. While analyzing Transaction 3, Yu notes that Ambleu purchased inventory on 1 June 2016 for FB27,000/ton. Ambleu pays for the inventory on 15 July 2016.

Note 3: The parent company transferred NVK15 million to Cendaró on 1 January 2016 to purchase a patent from a competitor for CRG85.17 million. Note 4: The 2016 consolidated balance sheet includes Ngcorp's total intangible assets of NVK3 million, which were added to Ngcorp's balance sheet on 15 July 2016.
Based on Exhibit 1 and Note 3 in Exhibit 2, the cumulative translation loss recognized by Ambleu related to the patent purchase on the 31 December 2017 financial statements is closest to:",NVK0.39 million.,NVK1.58 million,NVK9.12 million.,,B
35,"BetterCare Hospitals, Inc. operates a chain of hospitals throughout the United States. The company has been expanding by acquiring local hospitals. Its largest acquisition, that of Statewide Medical, was made in 2001 under the pooling of interests method.BetterCare complies with US GAAP.BetterCare is currently forming a 50/50 joint venture with Supreme Healthcare under which the companies will share control of several hospitals. BetterCare plans to use the equity method to account for the joint venture. Supreme Healthcare complies with IFRS and will use the proportionate consolidation method to account for the joint venture.Erik Ohalin is an equity analyst who covers both companies. He has estimated the joint venture's financial information for 2018 in order to prepare his estimates of each company's earnings and financial performance. This information is presented in Exhibit 1.

Supreme Healthcare recently announced it had formed a special purpose entity through which it plans to sell up to $100 million of its accounts receivable. Supreme Healthcare has no voting interest in the SPE, but it is expected to absorb any losses that it may incur. Ohalin wants to estimate the impact this will have on Supreme Healthcare's consolidated financial statements.
If Supreme Healthcare sells its receivables to the SPE, its consolidated financial results will least likely show:",a higher revenue for 2018.,the same cash balance at 31 December 2018.,the same accounts receivable balance at 31 December 2018.,,A
36,"Zimt, AG is a consumer products manufacturer headquartered in Austria. It complies with IFRS. In 2017, Zimt held a 10 percent passive stake in Oxbow Limited that was classified as held for trading securities. During the year, the value of this stake declined by €3 million. In December 2017, Zimt announced that it would be increasing its ownership to 50 percent effective 1 January 2018.Franz Gelblum, an analyst following both Zimt and Oxbow, is curious how the increased stake will affect Zimt's consolidated financial statements. Because Gelblum is uncertain how the company will account for the increased stake, he uses his existing forecasts for both companies' financial statements to compare various alternative outcomes.Gelblum gathers abbreviated financial statement data for Zimt (Exhibit 1) and Oxbow (Exhibit 2) for this purpose.

On 31 December 2018, NinMount paid ￡320 million to purchase a 50 percent stake in Boswell Company. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Boswell's net assets was attributable to previously unrecorded licenses. These licenses were estimated to have an economic life of six years. The fair value of Boswell's assets and liabilities other than licenses was equal to their recorded book values. NinMount and Boswell both use the pound sterling as their reporting currency and prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRS.Byron is concerned whether the investment should affect his “buy” rating on NinMount common stock. He knows NinMount could choose one of several accounting methods to report the results of its investment, but NinMount has not announced which method it will use. Byron forecasts that both companies' 2019 financial results (excluding any merger accounting adjustments) will be identical to those of 2018.NinMount's and Boswell's condensed income statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, and condensed balance sheets at 31 December 2018, are presented in Exhibits 1 and 2, respectively.

All of the national banks under consideration primarily make long-term loans and source a significant portion of their funding from retail deposits. Paulinic and the rest of the research team note that the central bank is unwinding a long period of monetary easing as evidenced by two recent increases in the overnight funding rate. Paulinic informs his supervisor that: Statement 1 Given the recently reported stronger-than-anticipated macro- economic data, there is an imminent risk that the yield curve will invert. Statement 2 N-bank is very active in the 30-day reverse repurchase agree- ment market during times when the bank experiences significant increases in retail deposits.
Paulinic’s analysis of the two insurance companies most likely indicates that:",Cobalt has more-predictable claims than Vermillion.,Cobalt has a higher capital requirement than Vermillion.,Vermillion’s calculated risk-based capital is more sensitive than Cobalt’s to interest rate risk.,,A

It was created on 31 December 20X1, and Consolidated Motors determined at that time that it should use the US dollar as its functional currency. Chief Financial Officer Monica Templeton was asked to explain to the board of directors how exchange rates affect the financial statements of both Consol-Can and the consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Motors. For the presentation, Templeton collects Consol-Can's balance sheets for the years ended 20X1 and 20X2 (Exhibit 1), as well as relevant exchange rate information (Exhibit 2).

Templeton explains that Consol-Can uses the FIFO inventory accounting method and that purchases of C$300 million and the sell-through of that inventory occurred evenly throughout 20X2. Her presentation includes reporting the translated amounts in US dollars for each item, as well as associated translation-related gains and losses. The board responds with several questions. ● Would there be a reason to change the functional currency to the Canadian dollar? ● Would there be any translation effects for Consolidated Motors if the functional currency for Consol-Can were changed to the Canadian dollar? ● Would a change in the functional currency have any impact on financial statement ratios for the parent company? ● What would be the balance sheet exposure to translation effects if the functional currency were changed?
In response to the board's first question, Templeton would most likely reply that such a change would be justified if:",the inflation rate in the United States became hyperinflationary.,management wanted to flow more of the gains through net income.,"onsol-Can were making autonomous decisions about operations, investing, and financing.",,C

Howard is preparing a research report on Confabulated Materials, SA, a publicly traded com- pany based in France that complies with IFRS 9. As part of his analysis, Howard has assembled data gathered from the financial statement footnotes of Confabulated’s 2018 Annual Report and from discussions with company management. Howard is concerned about the effect of this information on Confabulated’s future earnings. Information about Confabulated’s investment portfolio for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018 is presented in Exhibit 1. As part of his research, Howard is considering the possible effect on reported income of Confabulated’s accounting classification for fixed income investments.

In addition, Confabulated’s annual report discusses a transaction under which receiv- ables were securitized through a special purpose entity (SPE) for Confabulated’s benefit.

49,"John Thronen is an analyst in the research department of an international securities firm. He is preparing a research report on Topmaker, Inc., a publicly traded company that complies with IFRS.On 1 January 2016, Topmaker invested $11 million in Blanca Co. debt securities (with a 5.0% stated coupon on par value, and interest payable each 31 December). The par value of the securities is $10 million, and the market interest rate in effect when the bonds were purchased was 4.0%. Topmaker designates the investment as held to maturity. As of 31 December 2016, the fair value of the securities is $12 million.Blanca Co. wants to raise $40 million in capital by borrowing against its financial receivables. Blanca plans to create a special-purpose entity (SPE), invest $10 million in the SPE, have the SPE borrow $40 million, and then use the funds to purchase $50 million of receivables from Blanca. Blanca meets the definition of control and plans to consolidate the SPE. Blanca's balance sheet is presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Blanca Co.Balance Sheet at 31 December 2016(S mill ons) |

| Total assets | 100 | Total liabilities and equity | 100 |


Also on 1 January 2016, Topmaker acquired a 15% equity interest with voting power in Rainer Co. for $300 million. Topmaker has representation on Rainer's board of directors and participates in Rainer's policymaking process. Thronen believes that Topmaker underestimated the goodwill and balance sheet value of its investment account in Rainer. To estimate these figures, Thronen gathers selected financial information for Rainer as of 31 December 2016 in Exhibit 2. The plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis and have 10 years of remaining life.
| Exhibit 2.Selected Financial Data for Rainer Co., Year Ending 31 December 2016 |

| Total assets | 3，170 | 3，430 |
| Liabilities | 1，830 | 1，830 |
| Net assets | 1，340 | 1，600 |


During 2016, Rainer sold $60 million in inventory to Topmaker for $80 million. In 2017, Topmaker resold the entire inventory to a third party.Thronen is concerned about possible goodwill impairment resulting from expected changes in the industry effective at the end of 2017. He calculates the impairment loss based on the projected consolidated balance sheet data shown in Exhibit 3, assuming that the cash-generating unit and reporting unit of Topmaker are the same.

Finally, Topmaker announces its plan to increase its ownership interest in Rainer to 80% effective 1 January 2018. It will account for the investment in Rainer using the partial goodwill method. Thronen estimates that the fair market value of the Rainer's shares on the expected date of exchange is $2 billion, with the identifiable assets valued at $1.5 billion.
Based on Exhibit 3, Topmaker's impairment loss under IFRS is:",$120 million.,$300 million.,$400 million.,,B

57,"Zimt, AG is a consumer products manufacturer headquartered in Austria. It complies with IFRS. In 2009, Zimt held a 10 percent passive stake in Oxbow Limited that was classified as held for trading securities. During the year, the value of this stake declined by €3 million. In December 2009, Zimt announced that it would be increasing its ownership to 50 percent effective 1 January 2010.Franz Gelblum, an analyst following both Zimt and Oxbow, is curious how the increased stake will affect Zimt's consolidated financial statements. Because Gelblum is uncertain how the company will account for the increased stake, he uses his existing forecasts for both companies' financial statements to compare various alternative outcomes.Gelblum gathers abbreviated financial statement data for Zimt (Exhibit 1) and Oxbow (Exhibit 2) for this purpose.

58,"Quentin Abay, CFA, is an analyst for a private equity firm interested in purchasing Bickchip Enterprises, a conglomerate. His first task is to determine the trends in ROE and the main drivers of the trends using DuPont analysis. To do so he gathers the data in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Selected Financial Data for Bick chip Enterprises(e Thousands) |

| Asset turnover | 0.79 | 0.76 | 0.68 |
| Assets/Equity | 3.09 | 3.38 | 3.43 |


After conducting the DuPont analysis, Abay believes that his firm could increase the ROE without operational changes. Further, Abay thinks that ROE could improve if the company divested segments that were generating the lowest returns on capital employed (total assets less non-interest-bearing liabilities). Segment EBIT margins in 2009 were 11 percent for Automation Equipment, 5 percent for Power and Industrial, and 8 percent for Medical Equipment. Other relevant segment information is presented in Exhibit 2.

Abay is also concerned with earnings quality, so he intends to calculate Bickchip's cash-flow-based accruals ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow before interest and taxes to operating income. To do so, he prepares the information in Exhibit 3.

59,"Triofind, Inc. (Triofind), based in the country of Norvolt, provides wireless services to various countries, including Norvolt, Borliand, Abuelio, and Certait. The company's presentation currency is the Norvolt euro (NER), and Triofind complies with IFRS. Triofind has two wholly owned subsidiaries, located in Borliand and Abuelio. The Borliand subsidiary (Triofind-B) was established on 30 June 2016, by Triofind both investing NER1,000,000, which was converted into Borliand dollars (BRD), and borrowing an additional BRD500,000.Marie Janssen, a financial analyst in Triofind's Norvolt headquarters office, translates Triofind-B's financial statements using the temporal method. Non-monetary assets are measured at cost under the lower of cost or market rule.

Janssen next analyzes Triofind's Abuelio subsidiary (Triofind-A), which uses the current rate method to translate its results into Norvolt euros. Triofind-A, which prices its goods in Abuelio pesos (ABP), sells mobile phones to a customer in Certait on 31 May 2017 and receives payment of 1 million Certait rand (CRD) on 31 July 2017.On 31 May 2017, Triofind-A also received NER50,000 from Triofind and used the funds to purchase a new warehouse in Abuelio. Janssen translates the financial statements of Triofind-A as of 31 July 2017 and must determine the appropriate value for the warehouse in Triofind's presentation currency. She observes that the cumulative Abuelio inflation rate exceeded 100% from 2015 to 2017. Spot exchange rates and inflation data are presented in Exhibit 3.

| 31 July 2017 | 0.2632 | 0.0312 | 22 |


Janssen gathers corporate tax rate data and company disclosure information to include in Triofind's annual report. She determines that the corporate tax rates for Abuelio, Norvolt, and Borliand are 35%, 34%, and 0%, respectively, and that Norvolt exempts the non-domestic income of multinationals from taxation. Triofind-B constitutes 25% of Triofind's net income, and Triofind-A constitutes 15%. Janssen also gathers data on components of net sales growth in different countries, presented in Exhibit 4.

All of the national banks under consideration primarily make long-term loans and source a significant portion of their funding from retail deposits. Paulinic and the rest of the research team note that the central bank is unwinding a long period of monetary easing as evidenced by two recent increases in the overnight funding rate. Paulinic informs his supervisor that: Statement 1 Given the recently reported stronger-than-anticipated macro- economic data, there is an imminent risk that the yield curve will invert. Statement 2 N-bank is very active in the 30-day reverse repurchase agree- ment market during times when the bank experiences significant increases in retail deposits.

61,"Emmitt Dodd is a portfolio manager for Upsilon Advisers. Dodd meets with Sonya Webster, the firm's analyst responsible for the machinery industry, to discuss three established companies: BIG Industrial, Construction Supply, and Dynamic Production. Webster provides Dodd with research notes for each company that reflect trends during the last three years:BIG Industrial: Note 1 Operating income has been much lower than operating cash flow (OCF).Note 2 Accounts payable has increased, while accounts receivable and inventory have substantially decreased.Note 3 Although OCF was positive, it was just sufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Construction Supply: Note 4 Operating margins have been relatively constant.Note 5 The growth rate in revenue has exceeded the growth rate in receivables.Note 6 OCF was stable and positive, close to its reported net income, and just sufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Dynamic Production: Note 7 OCF has been more volatile than that of other industry participants.Note 8 OCF has fallen short of covering capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments. Dodd asks Webster about the use of quantitative tools to assess the likelihood of misreporting. Webster tells Dodd she uses the Beneish model, and she presents the estimated M-scores for each company in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Be neish Model M-scores |
| Company | 2017 | 2016 | Change in M-score |
| BIG Industrial | -1.54 | -1.82 | 0.28 |
| Construction Supply | -2.60 | -2.51 | -0.09 |
| Dynamic Production | -1.86 | -1.12 | -0.74 |


Webster tells Dodd that Dynamic Production was required to restate its 2016 financial statements as a result of its attempt to inflate sales revenue. Customers of Dynamic Production were encouraged to take excess product in 2016, and they were then allowed to return purchases in the subsequent period, without penalty. Webster's industry analysis leads her to believe that innovations have caused some of the BIG Industrial's inventory to become obsolete. Webster expresses concern to Dodd that although the notes to the financial statements for BIG Industrial are informative about its inventory cost methods, its inventory is overstated. The BIG Industrial income statement reflects a profitable 49% unconsolidated equity investment. Webster calculates the return on sales of BIG Industrial based on the reported income statement. Dodd notes that industry peers consolidate similar investments. Dodd asks Webster to use a comparable method of calculating the return on sales for BIG Industrial.
Based on the information related to its restatement, Dynamic Production reported poor operating cash flow quality in 2016 by understating:",inventories.,net income.,trade receivables.,,A

Templeton explains that Consol-Can uses the FIFO inventory accounting method and that purchases of C$300 million and the sell-through of that inventory occurred evenly throughout 20X2. Her presentation includes reporting the translated amounts in US dollars for each item, as well as associated translation-related gains and losses. The board responds with several questions. ● Would there be a reason to change the functional currency to the Canadian dollar? ● Would there be any translation effects for Consolidated Motors if the functional currency for Consol-Can were changed to the Canadian dollar? ● Would a change in the functional currency have any impact on financial statement ratios for the parent company? ● What would be the balance sheet exposure to translation effects if the functional currency were changed?

69,"Percy Byron, CFA, is an equity analyst with a UK-based investment firm. One firm Byron follows is NinMount PLC, a UK-based company. On 31 December 2008, NinMount paid ￡320 million to purchase a 50 percent stake in Boswell Company. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Boswell's net assets was attributable to previously unrecorded licenses. These licenses were estimated to have an economic life of six years. The fair value of Boswell's assets and liabilities other than licenses was equal to their recorded book values. NinMount and Boswell both use the pound sterling as their reporting currency and prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Byron is concerned whether the investment should affect his “buy” rating on NinMount common stock. He knows NinMount could choose one of several accounting methods to report the results of its investment, but NinMount has not announced which method it will use. Byron forecasts that both companies' 2009 financial results (excluding any merger accounting adjustments) will be identical to those of 2008. NinMount's and Boswell's condensed income statements for the year ended 31 December 2008, and condensed balance sheets at 31 December 2008, are presented in Exhibits 1 and 2, respectively.

One such subsidiary, Acceletron, operates in Singapore, which has seen mild but not excessive rates of inflation. Acceletron was acquired in 2000 and has never paid a dividend. It records inventory using the FIFO method. Chief Financial Officer Margot Villiers was asked by Redline's board of directors to explain how the functional currency selection and other accounting choices affect Redline's consolidated financial statements. Villiers gathers Acceletron's financial statements denominated in Singapore dollars (SGD) in Exhibit 1 and the US dollar/Singapore dollar exchange rates in Exhibit 2. She does not intend to identify the functional currency actually in use but rather to use Acceletron as an example of how the choice of functional currency affects the consolidated statements.

71,"John Thronen is an analyst in the research department of an international securities firm. He is preparing a research report on Topmaker, Inc., a publicly traded company that complies with IFRS.On 1 January 2016, Topmaker invested $11 million in Blanca Co. debt securities (with a 5.0% stated coupon on par value, and interest payable each 31 December). The par value of the securities is $10 million, and the market interest rate in effect when the bonds were purchased was 4.0%. Topmaker designates the investment as held to maturity. As of 31 December 2016, the fair value of the securities is $12 million.Blanca Co. wants to raise $40 million in capital by borrowing against its financial receivables. Blanca plans to create a special-purpose entity (SPE), invest $10 million in the SPE, have the SPE borrow $40 million, and then use the funds to purchase $50 million of receivables from Blanca. Blanca meets the definition of control and plans to consolidate the SPE. Blanca's balance sheet is presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Blanca Co.Balance Sheet at 31 December 2016(S mill ons) |

Also on 1 January 2016, Topmaker acquired a 15% equity interest with voting power in Rainer Co. for $300 million. Topmaker has representation on Rainer's board of directors and participates in Rainer's policymaking process. Thronen believes that Topmaker underestimated the goodwill and balance sheet value of its investment account in Rainer. To estimate these figures, Thronen gathers selected financial information for Rainer as of 31 December 2016 in Exhibit 2. The plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis and have 10 years of remaining life.
| Exhibit 2.Selected Financial Data for Rainer Co., Year Ending 31 December 2016 |

| Net assets | 1，340 | 1，600 |


During 2016, Rainer sold $60 million in inventory to Topmaker for $80 million. In 2017, Topmaker resold the entire inventory to a third party.Thronen is concerned about possible goodwill impairment resulting from expected changes in the industry effective at the end of 2017. He calculates the impairment loss based on the projected consolidated balance sheet data shown in Exhibit 3, assuming that the cash-generating unit and reporting unit of Topmaker are the same.

Finally, Topmaker announces its plan to increase its ownership interest in Rainer to 80% effective 1 January 2018. It will account for the investment in Rainer using the partial goodwill method. Thronen estimates that the fair market value of the Rainer's shares on the expected date of exchange is $2 billion, with the identifiable assets valued at $1.5 billion.
The value of the minority interest at the acquisition date of 1 January 2018 is:",$300 million.,$400 million.,$500 million.,,A
72,"Zimt, AG is a consumer products manufacturer headquartered in Austria. It complies with IFRS. In 2017, Zimt held a 10 percent passive stake in Oxbow Limited that was classified as held for trading securities. During the year, the value of this stake declined by €3 million. In December 2017, Zimt announced that it would be increasing its ownership to 50 percent effective 1 January 2018.Franz Gelblum, an analyst following both Zimt and Oxbow, is curious how the increased stake will affect Zimt's consolidated financial statements. Because Gelblum is uncertain how the company will account for the increased stake, he uses his existing forecasts for both companies' financial statements to compare various alternative outcomes.Gelblum gathers abbreviated financial statement data for Zimt (Exhibit 1) and Oxbow (Exhibit 2) for this purpose.

Janssen next analyzes Triofind's Abuelio subsidiary (Triofind-A), which uses the current rate method to translate its results into Norvolt euros. Triofind-A, which prices its goods in Abuelio pesos (ABP), sells mobile phones to a customer in Certait on 31 May 2017 and receives payment of 1 million Certait rand (CRD) on 31 July 2017.On 31 May 2017, Triofind-A also received NER50,000 from Triofind and used the funds to purchase a new warehouse in Abuelio. Janssen translates the financial statements of Triofind-A as of 31 July 2017 and must determine the appropriate value for the warehouse in Triofind's presentation currency. She observes that the cumulative Abuelio inflation rate exceeded 100% from 2015 to 2017. Spot exchange rates and inflation data are presented in Exhibit 3.

Janssen gathers corporate tax rate data and company disclosure information to include in Triofind's annual report. She determines that the corporate tax rates for Abuelio, Norvolt, and Borliand are 35%, 34%, and 0%, respectively, and that Norvolt exempts the non-domestic income of multinationals from taxation. Triofind-B constitutes 25% of Triofind's net income, and Triofind-A constitutes 15%. Janssen also gathers data on components of net sales growth in different countries, presented in Exhibit 4.

The funds were converted into hryvnia (UAH) on 31 December 20X1 at an exchange rate of EUR1.00 = UAH6.70 and used to purchase UAH1,500 million in fixed assets and UAH300 of inventories.Ruiz is concerned about the effect that the subsidiary's results might have on Eurexim's consolidated financial statements. He calls Eurexim's Chief Financial Officer, but learns little. Eurexim is not willing to share sales forecasts and has not even made a determination as to the subsidiary's functional currency.Absent more useful information, Ruiz decides to explore various scenarios to determine the potential impact on Eurexim's consolidated financial statements. Ukraine is not currently in a hyperinflationary environment, but Ruiz is concerned that this situation could change. Ruiz also believes the euro will appreciate against the hryvnia for the foreseeable future.

Dodd meets with Sonya Webster, the firm's analyst responsible for the machinery industry, to discuss three established companies: BIG Industrial, Construction Supply, and Dynamic Production. Webster provides Dodd with research notes for each company that reflect trends during the last three years:BIG Industrial: Note 1 Operating income has been much lower than operating cash flow (OCF).Note 2 Accounts payable has increased, while accounts receivable and inventory have substantially decreased.Note 3 Although OCF was positive, it was just sufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Construction Supply: Note 4 Operating margins have been relatively constant.Note 5 The growth rate in revenue has exceeded the growth rate in receivables.Note 6 OCF was stable and positive, close to its reported net income, and just sufficient to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments.Dynamic Production: Note 7 OCF has been more volatile than that of other industry participants.Note 8 OCF has fallen short of covering capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments. Dodd asks Webster about the use of quantitative tools to assess the likelihood of misreporting. Webster tells Dodd she uses the Beneish model, and she presents the estimated M-scores for each company in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Be neish Model M-scores |
| Company | 2017 | 2016 | Change in M-score |

| Construction Supply | -2.60 | -2.51 | -0.09 |
| Dynamic Production | -1.86 | -1.12 | -0.74 |


Webster tells Dodd that Dynamic Production was required to restate its 2016 financial statements as a result of its attempt to inflate sales revenue. Customers of Dynamic Production were encouraged to take excess product in 2016, and they were then allowed to return purchases in the subsequent period, without penalty. Webster's industry analysis leads her to believe that innovations have caused some of the BIG Industrial's inventory to become obsolete. Webster expresses concern to Dodd that although the notes to the financial statements for BIG Industrial are informative about its inventory cost methods, its inventory is overstated. The BIG Industrial income statement reflects a profitable 49% unconsolidated equity investment. Webster calculates the return on sales of BIG Industrial based on the reported income statement. Dodd notes that industry peers consolidate similar investments. Dodd asks Webster to use a comparable method of calculating the return on sales for BIG Industrial.

82,"Triofind, Inc. (Triofind), based in the country of Norvolt, provides wireless services to various countries, including Norvolt, Borliand, Abuelio, and Certait. The company's presentation currency is the Norvolt euro (NER), and Triofind complies with IFRS. Triofind has two wholly owned subsidiaries, located in Borliand and Abuelio. The Borliand subsidiary (Triofind-B) was established on 30 June 2016, by Triofind both investing NER1,000,000, which was converted into Borliand dollars (BRD), and borrowing an additional BRD500,000.Marie Janssen, a financial analyst in Triofind's Norvolt headquarters office, translates Triofind-B's financial statements using the temporal method. Non-monetary assets are measured at cost under the lower of cost or market rule.

Janssen next analyzes Triofind's Abuelio subsidiary (Triofind-A), which uses the current rate method to translate its results into Norvolt euros. Triofind-A, which prices its goods in Abuelio pesos (ABP), sells mobile phones to a customer in Certait on 31 May 2017 and receives payment of 1 million Certait rand (CRD) on 31 July 2017.On 31 May 2017, Triofind-A also received NER50,000 from Triofind and used the funds to purchase a new warehouse in Abuelio. Janssen translates the financial statements of Triofind-A as of 31 July 2017 and must determine the appropriate value for the warehouse in Triofind's presentation currency. She observes that the cumulative Abuelio inflation rate exceeded 100% from 2015 to 2017. Spot exchange rates and inflation data are presented in Exhibit 3.

Janssen gathers corporate tax rate data and company disclosure information to include in Triofind's annual report. She determines that the corporate tax rates for Abuelio, Norvolt, and Borliand are 35%, 34%, and 0%, respectively, and that Norvolt exempts the non-domestic income of multinationals from taxation. Triofind-B constitutes 25% of Triofind's net income, and Triofind-A constitutes 15%. Janssen also gathers data on components of net sales growth in different countries, presented in Exhibit 4.

83,"Adrienne Yu is an analyst with an international bank. She analyzes Ambleu S.A. (“Ambleu”), a multinational corporation, for a client presentation. Ambleu complies with IFRS, and its presentation currency is the Norvoltian krone (NVK). Ambleu's two subsidiaries, Ngcorp and Cendaró, have different functional currencies: Ngcorp uses the Bindiar franc (FB) and Cendaró uses the Crenland guinea (CRG). Yu first analyzes the following three transactions to assess foreign currency transaction exposure: Transaction 1: Cendaró sells goods to a non-domestic customer that pays in dollars on the purchase date. Transaction 2: Ngcorp obtains a loan in Bindiar francs on 1 June 2016 from a European bank with the Norvoltian krone as its presentation currency. Transaction 3: Ambleu imports inventory from Bindiar under 45-day credit terms, and the payment is to be denominated in Bindiar francs. Yu then reviews Transactions 2 and 3. She determines the method that Ambleu would use to translate Transaction 2 into its 31 December 2016 consolidated financial statements. While analyzing Transaction 3, Yu notes that Ambleu purchased inventory on 1 June 2016 for FB27,000/ton. Ambleu pays for the inventory on 15 July 2016.

Ruiz has learned that Eurexim used EUR220 million of its own cash and borrowed an equal amount to open a subsidiary in Ukraine. The funds were converted into hryvnia (UAH) on 31 December 20X1 at an exchange rate of EUR1.00 = UAH6.70 and used to purchase UAH1,500 million in fixed assets and UAH300 of inventories.Ruiz is concerned about the effect that the subsidiary's results might have on Eurexim's consolidated financial statements. He calls Eurexim's Chief Financial Officer, but learns little. Eurexim is not willing to share sales forecasts and has not even made a determination as to the subsidiary's functional currency.Absent more useful information, Ruiz decides to explore various scenarios to determine the potential impact on Eurexim's consolidated financial statements. Ukraine is not currently in a hyperinflationary environment, but Ruiz is concerned that this situation could change.

On 31 December 2008, NinMount paid ￡320 million to purchase a 50 percent stake in Boswell Company. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Boswell's net assets was attributable to previously unrecorded licenses. These licenses were estimated to have an economic life of six years. The fair value of Boswell's assets and liabilities other than licenses was equal to their recorded book values. NinMount and Boswell both use the pound sterling as their reporting currency and prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Byron is concerned whether the investment should affect his “buy” rating on NinMount common stock. He knows NinMount could choose one of several accounting methods to report the results of its investment, but NinMount has not announced which method it will use. Byron forecasts that both companies' 2009 financial results (excluding any merger accounting adjustments) will be identical to those of 2008.

Ambleu complies with IFRS, and its presentation currency is the Norvoltian krone (NVK). Ambleu's two subsidiaries, Ngcorp and Cendaró, have different functional currencies: Ngcorp uses the Bindiar franc (FB) and Cendaró uses the Crenland guinea (CRG). Yu first analyzes the following three transactions to assess foreign currency transaction exposure: Transaction 1: Cendaró sells goods to a non-domestic customer that pays in dollars on the purchase date. Transaction 2: Ngcorp obtains a loan in Bindiar francs on 1 June 2016 from a European bank with the Norvoltian krone as its presentation currency. Transaction 3: Ambleu imports inventory from Bindiar under 45-day credit terms, and the payment is to be denominated in Bindiar francs. Yu then reviews Transactions 2 and 3. She determines the method that Ambleu would use to translate Transaction 2 into its 31 December 2016 consolidated financial statements. While analyzing Transaction 3, Yu notes that Ambleu purchased inventory on 1 June 2016 for FB27,000/ton. Ambleu pays for the inventory on 15 July 2016.

Chief Financial Officer Margot Villiers was asked by Redline's board of directors to explain how the functional currency selection and other accounting choices affect Redline's consolidated financial statements. Villiers gathers Acceletron's financial statements denominated in Singapore dollars (SGD) in Exhibit 1 and the US dollar/Singapore dollar exchange rates in Exhibit 2.

During 2016, Rainer sold $60 million in inventory to Topmaker for $80 million. In 2017, Topmaker resold the entire inventory to a third party.Thronen is concerned about possible goodwill impairment resulting from expected changes in the industry effective at the end of 2017. He calculates the impairment loss based on the projected consolidated balance sheet data shown in Exhibit 3, assuming that the cash-generating unit and reporting unit of Topmaker are the same.

102,"Percy Byron, CFA, is an equity analyst with a UK-based investment firm. One firm Byron follows is NinMount PLC, a UK-based company. On 31 December 2008, NinMount paid ￡320 million to purchase a 50 percent stake in Boswell Company. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Boswell's net assets was attributable to previously unrecorded licenses. These licenses were estimated to have an economic life of six years. The fair value of Boswell's assets and liabilities other than licenses was equal to their recorded book values. NinMount and Boswell both use the pound sterling as their reporting currency and prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Byron is concerned whether the investment should affect his “buy” rating on NinMount common stock. He knows NinMount could choose one of several accounting methods to report the results of its investment, but NinMount has not announced which method it will use. Byron forecasts that both companies' 2009 financial results (excluding any merger accounting adjustments) will be identical to those of 2008. NinMount's and Boswell's condensed income statements for the year ended 31 December 2008, and condensed balance sheets at 31 December 2008, are presented in Exhibits 1 and 2, respectively.

113,"Quentin Abay, CFA, is an analyst for a private equity firm interested in purchasing Bickchip Enterprises, a conglomerate. His first task is to determine the trends in ROE and the main drivers of the trends using DuPont analysis. To do so he gathers the data in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Selected Financial Data for Bick chip Enterprises(e Thousands) |
| 2009 | 2008 | 2007 |
| Revenue | 72，448 | 66，487 | 55，781 |
| Earnings before interest and tax | 6，270 | 4，710 | 3，609 |
| Earnings before tax | 5，101 | 4，114 | 3，168 |

| Asset turnover | 0.79 | 0.76 | 0.68 |
| Assets/Equity | 3.09 | 3.38 | 3.43 |


After conducting the DuPont analysis, Abay believes that his firm could increase the ROE without operational changes. Further, Abay thinks that ROE could improve if the company divested segments that were generating the lowest returns on capital employed (total assets less non-interest-bearing liabilities). Segment EBIT margins in 2009 were 11 percent for Automation Equipment, 5 percent for Power and Industrial, and 8 percent for Medical Equipment. Other relevant segment information is presented in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Segment Data for Bick chip Enterprises(E Thousands) |
| Operating Segments | 2009 | 2008 | 2007 | 2009 | 2008 | 2007 |

| 49，380 | 42，564 | 40，334 | 2，508 | 2，416 | 1，999 |


Abay is also concerned with earnings quality, so he intends to calculate Bickchip's cash-flow-based accruals ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow before interest and taxes to operating income. To do so, he prepares the information in Exhibit 3.
| Exhibit 3.Earnings Quality Data for Bick chip Enterprises(E Thousands) |

116,"Ivan Paulinic, an analyst at a large wealth management firm, meets with his supervisor to discuss adding financial institution equity securities to client portfolios. Paulinic focuses on Vermillion Insurance (Vermillion), a property and casualty company, and Cobalt Life Insurance (Cobalt). To evaluate Vermillion further, Paulinic compiles the information presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1Select Financial Ratios for Vermillion Insurance |

In addition to the insurance companies, Paulinic gathers data on three national banks that meet initial selection criteria but require further review. This information is shown in Exhibits 2, 3, and 4.
| Focusing on N-bank and T-bank， Paul nic prepares the following data. |

All of the national banks under consideration primarily make long-term loans and source a significant portion of their funding from retail deposits. Paulinic and the rest of the research team note that the central bank is unwinding a long period of monetary easing as evidenced by two recent increases in the overnight funding rate. Paulinic informs his supervisor that: Statement 1 Given the recently reported stronger-than-anticipated macro- economic data, there is an imminent risk that the yield curve will invert. Statement 2 N-bank is very active in the 30-day reverse repurchase agree- ment market during times when the bank experiences significant increases in retail deposits.
Based only on Exhibit 3, Paulinic should conclude that:",trading activities are riskier at T-bank than N-bank.,trading revenue per unit of risk has improved more at N-bank than T-bank.,"compared with duration, the metric used is a better measure of interest rate risk.",,B

118,"Percy Byron, CFA, is an equity analyst with a UK-based investment firm. One firm Byron follows is NinMount PLC, a UK-based company. On 31 December 2018, NinMount paid ￡320 million to purchase a 50 percent stake in Boswell Company. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Boswell's net assets was attributable to previously unrecorded licenses. These licenses were estimated to have an economic life of six years. The fair value of Boswell's assets and liabilities other than licenses was equal to their recorded book values. NinMount and Boswell both use the pound sterling as their reporting currency and prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRS.Byron is concerned whether the investment should affect his “buy” rating on NinMount common stock. He knows NinMount could choose one of several accounting methods to report the results of its investment, but NinMount has not announced which method it will use. Byron forecasts that both companies' 2019 financial results (excluding any merger accounting adjustments) will be identical to those of 2018.NinMount's and Boswell's condensed income statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, and condensed balance sheets at 31 December 2018, are presented in Exhibits 1 and 2, respectively.

119,"Cinnamon, Inc. is a diversified manufacturing company headquartered in the United Kingdom. It complies with IFRS. In 2009, Cinnamon held a 19 percent passive equity ownership interest in Cambridge Processing that was classified as available-for-sale. During the year, the value of this investment rose by ￡2 million. In December 2009, Cinnamon announced that it would be increasing its ownership interest to 50 percent effective 1 January 2010 through a cash purchase. Cinnamon and Cambridge have no intercompany transactions. Peter Lubbock, an analyst following both Cinnamon and Cambridge, is curious how the increased stake will affect Cinnamon's consolidated financial statements. He asks Cinnamon's CFO how the company will account for the investment, and is told that the decision has not yet been made. Lubbock decides to use his existing forecasts for both companies' financial statements to compare the outcomes of alternative accounting treatments.

120,"John Thronen is an analyst in the research department of an international securities firm. He is preparing a research report on Topmaker, Inc., a publicly traded company that complies with IFRS.On 1 January 2016, Topmaker invested $11 million in Blanca Co. debt securities (with a 5.0% stated coupon on par value, and interest payable each 31 December). The par value of the securities is $10 million, and the market interest rate in effect when the bonds were purchased was 4.0%. Topmaker designates the investment as held to maturity. As of 31 December 2016, the fair value of the securities is $12 million.Blanca Co. wants to raise $40 million in capital by borrowing against its financial receivables. Blanca plans to create a special-purpose entity (SPE), invest $10 million in the SPE, have the SPE borrow $40 million, and then use the funds to purchase $50 million of receivables from Blanca. Blanca meets the definition of control and plans to consolidate the SPE. Blanca's balance sheet is presented in Exhibit 1.

Also on 1 January 2016, Topmaker acquired a 15% equity interest with voting power in Rainer Co. for $300 million. Topmaker has representation on Rainer's board of directors and participates in Rainer's policymaking process. Thronen believes that Topmaker underestimated the goodwill and balance sheet value of its investment account in Rainer. To estimate these figures, Thronen gathers selected financial information for Rainer as of 31 December 2016 in Exhibit 2. The plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis and have 10 years of remaining life.

| Liabilities | 1，830 | 1，830 |
| Net assets | 1，340 | 1，600 |


During 2016, Rainer sold $60 million in inventory to Topmaker for $80 million. In 2017, Topmaker resold the entire inventory to a third party.Thronen is concerned about possible goodwill impairment resulting from expected changes in the industry effective at the end of 2017. He calculates the impairment loss based on the projected consolidated balance sheet data shown in Exhibit 3, assuming that the cash-generating unit and reporting unit of Topmaker are the same.

Finally, Topmaker announces its plan to increase its ownership interest in Rainer to 80% effective 1 January 2018. It will account for the investment in Rainer using the partial goodwill method. Thronen estimates that the fair market value of the Rainer's shares on the expected date of exchange is $2 billion, with the identifiable assets valued at $1.5 billion.
Which of the following statements regarding the sale of inventory by Rainer to Topmaker is correct?",The sale represents a downstream sale.,Topmaker's unrealized profits are initially deferred.,Profits will decline on Topmaker's 2016 income statement.,,B
121,"Adrienne Yu is an analyst with an international bank. She analyzes Ambleu S.A. (“Ambleu”), a multinational corporation, for a client presentation. Ambleu complies with IFRS, and its presentation currency is the Norvoltian krone (NVK). Ambleu's two subsidiaries, Ngcorp and Cendaró, have different functional currencies: Ngcorp uses the Bindiar franc (FB) and Cendaró uses the Crenland guinea (CRG). Yu first analyzes the following three transactions to assess foreign currency transaction exposure: Transaction 1: Cendaró sells goods to a non-domestic customer that pays in dollars on the purchase date. Transaction 2: Ngcorp obtains a loan in Bindiar francs on 1 June 2016 from a European bank with the Norvoltian krone as its presentation currency. Transaction 3: Ambleu imports inventory from Bindiar under 45-day credit terms, and the payment is to be denominated in Bindiar francs. Yu then reviews Transactions 2 and 3. She determines the method that Ambleu would use to translate Transaction 2 into its 31 December 2016 consolidated financial statements. While analyzing Transaction 3, Yu notes that Ambleu purchased inventory on 1 June 2016 for FB27,000/ton. Ambleu pays for the inventory on 15 July 2016. Exhibit 1 presents selected economic data for Bindiar and Crenland.

Prior to reviewing the 2016 and 2017 consolidated financial statements of Ambleu, Yu meets with her supervisor, who asks Yu the following two questions: Question 1 Would a foreign currency translation loss reduce Ambleu's net sales growth? Question 2 According to IFRS, what disclosures should be included relating to Ambleu's treatment of foreign currency translation for Ngcorp? To complete her assignment, Yu analyzes selected information and notes from Ambleu's 2016 and 2017 consolidated financial statements, presented in Exhibit 2.

123,"Percy Byron, CFA, is an equity analyst with a UK-based investment firm. One firm Byron follows is NinMount PLC, a UK-based company. On 31 December 2008, NinMount paid ￡320 million to purchase a 50 percent stake in Boswell Company. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Boswell's net assets was attributable to previously unrecorded licenses. These licenses were estimated to have an economic life of six years. The fair value of Boswell's assets and liabilities other than licenses was equal to their recorded book values. NinMount and Boswell both use the pound sterling as their reporting currency and prepare their financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Byron is concerned whether the investment should affect his “buy” rating on NinMount common stock. He knows NinMount could choose one of several accounting methods to report the results of its investment, but NinMount has not announced which method it will use. Byron forecasts that both companies' 2009 financial results (excluding any merger accounting adjustments) will be identical to those of 2008. NinMount's and Boswell's condensed income statements for the year ended 31 December 2008, and condensed balance sheets at 31 December 2008, are presented in Exhibits 1 and 2, respectively.
