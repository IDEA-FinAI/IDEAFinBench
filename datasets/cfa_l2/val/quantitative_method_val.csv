0,"Alef Associates manages a long-only fund specializing in global smallcap equities. Since its founding a decade ago, Alef maintains a portfolio of 100 stocks (out of an eligible universe of about 10,000 stocks). Some of these holdings are the result of screening the universe for attractive stocks based on several ratios that use readily available market and accounting data; others are the result of investment ideas generated by Alef’s professional staff of five securities analysts and two portfolio managers.Although Alef’s investment performance has been good, its Chief Investment Officer, Paul Moresanu, is contemplating a change in the investment process aimed at achieving even better returns. After attending multiple workshops and being approached by data vendors, Moresanu feels that data science should play a role in the way Alef selects its investments. He has also noticed that much of Alef’s past outperformance is due to stocks that became takeover targets. After some research and reflection, Moresanu writes the following email to the Alef’s CEO.Subject: Investment Process ReorganizationI have been thinking about modernizing the way we select stock investments. Given that our past success has put Alef Associates in an excellent financial position, now seems to be a good time to invest in our future. What I propose is that we continue managing a portfolio of 100 global small-cap stocks but restructure our process to benefit from machine learning (ML). Importantly, the new process will still allow a role for human insight, for example, in providing domain knowledge. In addition, I think we should make a special effort to identify companies that are likely to be acquired. Specifically, I suggest following the four steps which would be repeated every quarter.Step 1 We apply ML techniques to a model including fundamental and technical variables (features) to predict next quarter’s return for each of the 100 stocks currently in our portfolio. Then, the 20 stocks with the lowest estimated return are identified for replacement.Step 2 We utilize ML techniques to divide our investable universe of about 10,000 stocks into 20 different groups, based on a wide variety of the most relevant financial and non-financial characteristics. The idea is to prevent unintended portfolio concentration by selecting stocks from each of these distinct groups.Step 3 For each of the 20 different groups, we use labeled data to train a model that will predict the five stocks (in any given group) that are most likely to become acquisition targets in the next one year.Step 4 Our five experienced securities analysts are each assigned four of the groups, and then each analyst selects their one best stock pick from each of their assigned groups. These 20 “high-conviction” stocks will be added to our portfolio (in replacement of the 20 relatively underperforming stocks to be sold in Step 1).A couple of additional comments related to the above:Comment 1 The ML algorithms will require large amounts of data. We would first need to explore using free or inexpensive historical datasets and then evaluate their usefulness for the ML-based stock selection processes before deciding on using data that requires subscription.Comment 2 As time passes, we expect to find additional ways to apply ML techniques to refine Alef’s investment processes.What do you think?Paul Moresanu

2,"Aaliyah Schultz is a fixed-income portfolio manager at Aries Investments. Schultz supervises Ameris Steele, a junior analyst.A few years ago, Schultz developed a proprietary machine learning (ML) model that aims to predict downgrades of publicly-traded firms by bond rating agencies. The model currently relies only on structured financial data collected from different sources. Schultz thinks the model’s predictive power may be improved by incorporat-ing sentiment data derived from textual analysis of news articles and Twitter content relating to the subject companies.Schultz and Steele meet to discuss plans for incorporating the sentiment data into the model. They discuss the differences in the steps between building ML models that use traditional structured data and building ML models that use textual big data. Steele tells Schultz:Statement 1 The second step in building text-based ML models is text prepa-ration and wrangling, whereas the second step in building ML models using structured data is data collection.Statement 2 The fourth step in building both types of models encompasses data/text exploration.Steele expresses concern about using Twitter content in the model, noting that research suggests that as much as 10%–15% of social media content is from fake accounts. Schultz tells Steele that she understands her concern but thinks the potential for model improvement outweighs the concern.Steele begins building a model that combines the structured financial data and the sentiment data. She starts with cleansing and wrangling the raw structured financial data. Exhibit 1 presents a small sample of the raw dataset before cleansing: Each row represents data for a particular firm.
| Exhibit 1Sample of Raw Structured Data Before Cleansing |
| Industry | Interest |
| ID | Ticker | IPO Date | (NAICS) | EBIT | Expense | Total Debt |
| 1 | ABC | 4/6/17 | 44 | 9.4 | 0.6 | 10.1 |

| 4 | KLM | 14-Mar-15 | 72 | 5.7 | 1.5 | 0.0 |


After cleansing the data, Steele then preprocesses the dataset. She creates two new variables: an “Age” variable based on the firm’s IPO date and an “Interest Coverage Ratio” variable equal to EBIT divided by interest expense. She also deletes the “IPO Date” variable from the dataset. After applying these transformations, Steele scales the financial data using normalization. She notes that over the full sample dataset, the “Interest Expense” variable ranges from a minimum of 0.2 and a maximum of 12.2, with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of 0.4.Steele and Schultz then discuss how to preprocess the raw text data. Steele tells Schultz that the process can be completed in the following three steps:Step 1 Cleanse the raw text data.Step 2 Split the cleansed data into a collection of words for them to be normalized.Step 3 Normalize the collection of words from Step 2 and create a distinct set of tokens from the normalized words.With respect to Step 1, Steele tells Schultz:“I believe I should remove all html tags, punctuations, numbers, and extra white spaces from the data before normalizing them.”After properly cleansing the raw text data, Steele completes Steps 2 and 3. She then performs exploratory data analysis. To assist in feature selection, she wants to create a visualization that shows the most informative words in the dataset based on their term frequency (TF) values. After creating and analyzing the visualization, Steele is concerned that some tokens are likely to be noise features for ML model training; therefore, she wants to remove them.Steele and Schultz discuss the importance of feature selection and feature engi-neering in ML model training. Steele tells Schultz:“Appropriate feature selection is a key factor in minimizing model over-fitting, whereas feature engineering tends to prevent model underfitting.”Once satisfied with the final set of features, Steele selects and runs a model on the training set that classifies the text as having positive sentiment (Class “1” or negative sentiment (Class “0”). She then evaluates its performance using error analysis. The resulting confusion matrix is presented in Exhibit 2.

11,"Doris Honore is a securities analyst with a large wealth management firm. She and her colleague Bill Smith are addressing three research topics: how investment fund characteristics affect fund total returns, whether a fund rating system helps predict fund returns, and whether stock and bond market returns explain the returns of a portfolio of utility shares run by the firm.To explore the first topic, Honore decides to study US mutual funds using a sample of 555 large-cap US equity funds. The sample includes funds in style classes of value, growth, and blend (i.e., combining value and growth characteristics). The dependent variable is the average annualized rate of return (in percent) over the past five years. The independent variables are fund expense ratio, portfolio turnover, the natural logarithm of fund size, fund age, and three dummy variables. The multiple manager dummy variable has a value of 1 if the fund has multiple managers (and a value of 0 if it has a single manager). The fund style is indicated by a growth dummy (value of 1 for growth funds and 0 otherwise) and a blend dummy (value of 1 for blend funds and 0 otherwise). If the growth and blend dummies are both zero, the fund is a value fund. The regression output is given in Exhibit 1.

Based on the results shown in Exhibit 1, Honore wants to test the hypothesis that all of the regression coefficients are equal to zero. For the 555 fund sample, she also wants to compare the performance of growth funds with the value funds.Honore is concerned about the possible presence of multicollinearity in the regression. She states that adding a new independent variable that is highly correlated with one or more independent variables already in the regression model, has three potential consequences:1. The R2 is expected to decline.2. The regression coefficient estimates can become imprecise and unreliable.3. The standard errors for some or all of the regression coefficients will become inflated.Another concern for the regression model (in Exhibit 1) is conditional heteroskedasticity. Honore is concerned that the presence of heteroskedasticity can cause both the F-test for the overall significance of the regression and the t-tests for significance of individual regression coefficients to be unreliable. She runs a regression of the squared residuals from the model in Exhibit 1 on the eight independent variables, and finds the R2 is 0.0669.As a second research project, Honore wants to test whether including Morningstar's rating system, which assigns a one- through five-star rating to a fund, as an independent variable will improve the predictive power of the regression model. To do this, she needs to examine whether values of the independent variables in a given period predict fund return in the next period. Smith suggests three different methods of adding the Morningstar ratings to the model:■ Method 1: Add an independent variable that has a value equal to the number of stars in the rating of each fund.■Method 2: Add five dummy variables, one for each rating.■Method 3: Add dummy variables for four of the five ratings.As a third research project, Honore wants to establish whether bond market returns (proxied by returns of long-term US Treasuries) and stock market returns (proxied by returns of the S&P 500 Index) explain the returns of a portfolio of utility stocks being recommended to clients. Exhibit 2 presents the results of a regression of 10 years of monthly percentage total returns for the utility portfolio on monthly total returns for US Treasuries and the S&P 500.

For the time-series model in Exhibit 2, Honore says that positive serial correlation would not require that the estimated coefficients be adjusted, but that the standard errors of the regression coefficients would be underestimated. This issue would cause the t-statistics of the regression coefficients to be inflated. Honore tests the null hypothesis that the there is no serial correlation in the regression residuals and finds that the Durbin-Watson statistic is equal to 1.81. The critical values at the 0.05 significance level for the Durbin-Watson statistic are dl = 1.63 and du = 1.72.Smith asks whether Honore should have estimated the models in Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2 using a probit or logit model instead of using a traditional regression analysis.
Honore describes three potential consequences of multicollinearity. Are all three consequences correct?",Yes,"No, 1 is incorrect","No, 2 is incorrect",,B
12,"Aaliyah Schultz is a fixed-income portfolio manager at Aries Investments. Schultz supervises Ameris Steele, a junior analyst.A few years ago, Schultz developed a proprietary machine learning (ML) model that aims to predict downgrades of publicly-traded firms by bond rating agencies. The model currently relies only on structured financial data collected from different sources. Schultz thinks the model’s predictive power may be improved by incorporating sentiment data derived from textual analysis of news articles and Twitter content relating to the subject companies.Schultz and Steele meet to discuss plans for incorporating the sentiment data into the model. They discuss the differences in the steps between building ML models that use traditional structured data and building ML models that use textual big data. Steele tells Schultz:Statement 1 The second step in building text-based ML models is text preparation and wrangling, whereas the second step in building ML models using structured data is data collection.Statement 2 The fourth step in building both types of models encompasses data/text exploration.Steele expresses concern about using Twitter content in the model, noting that research suggests that as much as 10%–15% of social media content is from fake accounts. Schultz tells Steele that she understands her concern but thinks the potential for model improvement outweighs the concern.Steele begins building a model that combines the structured financial data and the sentiment data. She starts with cleansing and wrangling the raw structured financial data. Exhibit 1 presents a small sample of the raw dataset before cleansing: Each row represents data for a particular firm.

After cleansing the data, Steele then preprocesses the dataset. She creates two new variables: an “Age” variable based on the firm’s IPO date and an “Interest Coverage Ratio” variable equal to EBIT divided by interest expense. She also deletes the “IPO Date” variable from the dataset. After applying these transformations, Steele scales the financial data using normalization. She notes that over the full sample dataset, the “Interest Expense” variable ranges from a minimum of 0.2 and a maximum of 12.2, with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of 0.4.Steele and Schultz then discuss how to preprocess the raw text data. Steele tells Schultz that the process can be completed in the following three steps:Step 1 Cleanse the raw text data.Step 2 Split the cleansed data into a collection of words for them to be normalized.Step 3 Normalize the collection of words from Step 2 and create a distinct set of tokens from the normalized words.With respect to Step 1, Steele tells Schultz:“I believe I should remove all html tags, punctuations, numbers, and extra white spaces from the data before normalizing them.”After properly cleansing the raw text data, Steele completes Steps 2 and 3. She then performs exploratory data analysis. To assist in feature selection, she wants to create a visualization that shows the most informative words in the dataset based on their term frequency (TF) values. After creating and analyzing the visualization, Steele is concerned that some tokens are likely to be noise features for ML model training; therefore, she wants to remove them.Steele and Schultz discuss the importance of feature selection and feature engineering in ML model training. Steele tells Schultz:“Appropriate feature selection is a key factor in minimizing model overfitting, whereas feature engineering tends to prevent model underfitting.”Once satisfied with the final set of features, Steele selects and runs a model on the training set that classifies the text as having positive sentiment (Class “1” or negative sentiment (Class “0”). She then evaluates its performance using error analysis. The resulting confusion matrix is presented in Exhibit 2.

13,"Gary Hansen is a securities analyst for a mutual fund specializing in small-capitalization growth stocks. The fund regularly invests in initial public offerings (IPOs). If the fund subscribes to an offer, it is allocated shares at the offer price. Hansen notes that IPOs frequently are underpriced, and the price rises when open market trading begins. The initial return for an IPO is calculated as the change in price on the first day of trading divided by the offer price. Hansen is developing a regression model to predict the initial return for IPOs. Based on past research, he selects the following independent variables to predict IPO initial returns:
| Underwriter rank | = | 1-10， where 10is highest rank |
| Pre-offer price adjust men f |  | =(Offer price-Initial i ling price) /Inital filing price |
| Offer size($millions) | = | Shares sold x Offer price |
| Fraction retained | = | Fraction of total company shares retained by insiders |

Hansen wants to use the regression results to predict the initial return for an upcoming IPO. The upcoming IPO has the following characteristics:■ underwriter rank = 6;■pre-offer price adjustment = 0.04;■offer size = $40 million;■fraction retained = 0.70.Because he notes that the pre-offer price adjustment appears to have an important effect on initial return, Hansen wants to construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the coefficient on this variable. He also believes that for each 1 percent increase in pre-offer price adjustment, the initial return will increase by less than 0.5 percent, holding other variables constant. Hansen wishes to test this hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance.Before applying his model, Hansen asks a colleague, Phil Chang, to review its specification and results. After examining the model, Chang concludes that the model suffers from two problems: 1) conditional heteroskedasticity, and 2) omitted variable bias. Chang makes the following statements:Statement 1: “Conditional heteroskedasticity will result in consistent coefficient estimates, but both the t-statistics and F-statistic will be biased, resulting in false inferences.”Statement 2: “If an omitted variable is correlated with variables already included in the model, coefficient estimates will be biased and inconsistent and standard errors will also be inconsistent.”Selected values for the t-distribution and F-distribution appear in Exhibits 3 and 4, respectively.

15,"Adele Chiesa is a money manager for the Bianco Fund. She is interested in recent findings showing that certain business condition variables predict excess US stock market returns (one-month market return minus one-month T-bill return). She is also familiar with evidence showing how US stock market returns differ by the political party affiliation of the US President. Chiesa estimates a multiple regression model to predict monthly excess stock market returns accounting for business conditions and the political party affiliation of the US President:Excess stock market returnt= a0+ a1Default spreadt–1+ a2Term spreadt–1+ a3Pres party dummyt–1+ etDefault spread is equal to the yield on Baa bonds minus the yield on Aaa bonds. Term spread is equal to the yield on a 10-year constant-maturity US Treasury index minus the yield on a 1-year constant-maturity US Treasury index. Pres party dummy is equal to 1 if the US President is a member of the Democratic Party and 0 if a member of the Republican Party.Chiesa collects 432 months of data (all data are in percent form, i.e., 0.01 = 1 percent).

An intern working for Chiesa has a number of questions about the results in Exhibit 1:Question 1: How do you test to determine whether the overall regression model is significant?Question 2: Does the estimated model conform to standard regression assumptions? For instance, is the error term serially correlated, or is there conditional heteroskedasticity?Question 3: How do you interpret the coefficient for the Pres party dummy variable?Question 4: Default spread appears to be quite important. Is there some way to assess the precision of its estimated coefficient?

16,"Brad Varden, a junior analyst at an actively managed mutual fund, is responsible for research on a subset of the 500 large-cap equities the fund follows. Recently, the fund has been paying close attention to management turnover and to publicly available environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings. Varden is given the task of investigating whether any significant relationship exists between a company's profitability and either of these two characteristics. Colleen Quinni, a senior analyst at the fund, suggests that as an initial step in his investigation, Varden should perform a multiple regression analysis on the variables and report back to her.Varden knows that Quinni is an expert at quantitative research, and she once told Varden that after you get an idea, you should formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, and analyze the results. Varden expects to find that ESG rating is negatively related to ROE and CEO tenure is positively related to ROE. He considers a relationship meaningful when it is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. To begin, Varden collects values for ROE, CEO tenure, and ESG rating for a sample of 40 companies from the large-cap security universe. He performs a multiple regression with ROE (in percent) as the dependent variable and ESG rating and CEO tenure (in years) as the independent variables: Yi = b0 + b1X1i + b2X2i + εi.Exhibit 1 shows the regression results.

DF Associates is one of the companies Varden follows. He wants to predict its ROE using his regression model. DF Associates' corporate ESG rating is 55, and the company's CEO has been in that position for 10.5 years.Varden also wants to check on the relationship between these variables and the dividend growth rate (divgr), so he completes the correlation matrix shown in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Correlation Matrix |
| ROE | ESG | Tenure | Div gr |
| ROE | 1.0 |

| Tenure | 0.369 | 0.091 | 1.0 |
| Div gr | 0.117 | 0.046 | 0.028 | 1.0 |


Investigating further, Varden determines that dividend growth is not a linear combination of CEO tenure and ESG rating. He is unclear about how additional independent variables would affect the significance of the regression, so he asks Quinni, ""Given this correlation matrix, will both R2 and adjusted R2 automatically increase if I add dividend growth as a third independent variable?""The discussion continues, and Quinni asks two questions.1. What does your F-statistic of 4.161 tell you about the regression?2. In interpreting the overall significance of your regression model, which statistic do you believe is most relevant: R2, adjusted R2, or the F-statistic?Varden answers both questions correctly and says he wants to check two more ideas. He believes the following:1. ROE is less correlated with the dividend growth rate in firms whose CEO has been in office more than 15 years, and2. CEO tenure is a normally distributed random variable.Later, Varden includes the dividend growth rate as a third independent variable and runs the regression on the fund's entire group of 500 large-cap equities. He finds that the adjusted R2 is much higher than the results in Exhibit 1. He reports this to Quinni and says, “Adding the dividend growth rate gives a model with a higher adjusted R2. The three-variable model is clearly better.” Quinni cautions, ""I don't think you can conclude that yet.”
If Varden's beliefs about ROE and CEO tenure are true, which of the following would violate the assumptions of multiple regression analysis?",The assumption about CEO tenure distribution only,The assumption about the ROE/dividend growth correlation only,The assumptions about both the ROE/dividend growth correlation and CEO tenure distribution,,C

18,"Doris Honoré is a securities analyst with a large wealth management firm. She and her colleague Bill Smith are addressing three research topics: how investment fund characteristics affect fund total returns, whether a fund rating system helps predict fund returns, and whether stock and bond market returns explain the returns of a portfolio of utility shares run by the firm.To explore the first topic, Honoré decides to study US mutual funds using a sample of 555 large-cap US equity funds. The sample includes funds in style classes of value, growth, and blend (i.e., combining value and growth characteristics). The dependent variable is the average annualized rate of return (in percent) over the past five years. The independent variables are fund expense ratio, portfolio turnover, the natural logarithm of fund size, fund age, and three dummy variables. The multiple manager dummy variable has a value of 1 if the fund has multiple managers (and a value of 0 if it has a single manager). The fund style is indicated by a growth dummy (value of 1 for growth funds and 0 otherwise) and a blend dummy (value of 1 for blend funds and 0 otherwise). If the growth and blend dummies are both zero, the fund is a value fund. The regression output is given in Exhibit 1.

Based on the results shown in Exhibit 1, Honoré wants to test the hypothesis that all of the regression coefficients are equal to zero. For the 555 fund sample, she also wants to compare the performance of growth funds with the value funds.Honoré is concerned about the possible presence of multicollinearity in the regression. She states that adding a new independent variable that is highly correlated with one or more independent variables already in the regression model, has three potential consequences:1. The R2 is expected to decline.2. The regression coefficient estimates can become imprecise and unreliable.3. The standard errors for some or all of the regression coefficients will become inflated.Another concern for the regression model (in Exhibit 1) is conditional heteroskedasticity. Honoré is concerned that the presence of heteroskedasticity can cause both the F-test for the overall significance of the regression and the t-tests for significance of individual regression coefficients to be unreliable. She runs a regression of the squared residuals from the model in Exhibit 1 on the eight independent variables and finds the R2 is 0.0669.As a second research project, Honoré wants to test whether including Morningstar’s rating system, which assigns a one- through five-star rating to a fund, as an independent variable will improve the predictive power of the regression model. To do this, she needs to examine whether values of the independent variables in a given period predict fund return in the next period. Smith suggests three different methods of adding the Morningstar ratings to the model:Method 1: Add an independent variable that has a value equal to the number of stars in the rating of each fund.Method 2: Add five dummy variables, one for each rating.Method 3: Add dummy variables for four of the five ratings.As a third research project, Honoré wants to establish whether bond market returns (proxied by returns of long-term US Treasuries) and stock market returns (proxied by returns of the S&P 500 Index) explain the returns of a portfolio of utility stocks being recommended to clients. Exhibit 2 presents the results of a regression of 10 years of monthly percentage total returns for the utility portfolio on monthly total returns for US Treasuries and the S&P 500.

19,"Brad Varden, a junior analyst at an actively managed mutual fund, is responsible for research on a subset of the 500 large-cap equities the fund follows. Recently, the fund has been paying close attention to management turnover and to publicly available environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings. Varden is given the task of investigating whether any significant relationship exists between a company's profitability and either of these two characteristics. Colleen Quinni, a senior analyst at the fund, suggests that as an initial step in his investigation, Varden should perform a multiple regression analysis on the variables and report back to her.Varden knows that Quinni is an expert at quantitative research, and she once told Varden that after you get an idea, you should formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, and analyze the results. Varden expects to find that ESG rating is negatively related to ROE and CEO tenure is positively related to ROE. He considers a relationship meaningful when it is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. To begin, Varden collects values for ROE, CEO tenure, and ESG rating for a sample of 40 companies from the large-cap security universe. He performs a multiple regression with ROE (in percent) as the dependent variable and ESG rating and CEO tenure (in years) as the independent variables: Yi = b0 + b1X1i + b2X2i + εi.Exhibit 1 shows the regression results.

DF Associates is one of the companies Varden follows. He wants to predict its ROE using his regression model. DF Associates' corporate ESG rating is 55, and the company's CEO has been in that position for 10.5 years.Varden also wants to check on the relationship between these variables and the dividend growth rate (divgr), so he completes the correlation matrix shown in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Correlation Matrix |
| ROE | ESG | Tenure | Div gr |
| ROE | 1.0 |

| Tenure | 0.369 | 0.091 | 1.0 |
| Div gr | 0.117 | 0.046 | 0.028 | 1.0 |


Investigating further, Varden determines that dividend growth is not a linear combination of CEO tenure and ESG rating. He is unclear about how additional independent variables would affect the significance of the regression, so he asks Quinni, ""Given this correlation matrix, will both R2 and adjusted R2 automatically increase if I add dividend growth as a third independent variable?""The discussion continues, and Quinni asks two questions.1. What does your F-statistic of 4.161 tell you about the regression?2. In interpreting the overall significance of your regression model, which statistic do you believe is most relevant: R2, adjusted R2, or the F-statistic?Varden answers both questions correctly and says he wants to check two more ideas. He believes the following:1. ROE is less correlated with the dividend growth rate in firms whose CEO has been in office more than 15 years, and2. CEO tenure is a normally distributed random variable.Later, Varden includes the dividend growth rate as a third independent variable and runs the regression on the fund's entire group of 500 large-cap equities. He finds that the adjusted R2 is much higher than the results in Exhibit 1. He reports this to Quinni and says, “Adding the dividend growth rate gives a model with a higher adjusted R2. The three-variable model is clearly better.” Quinni cautions, ""I don't think you can conclude that yet.”
Based on Exhibit 1 and given Varden's expectations, which is the best null hypothesis and conclusion regarding CEO tenure?",b<sub>2</sub> ≤ 0; reject the null hypothesis,b<sub>2</sub> = 0; cannot reject the null hypothesis,b<sub>2</sub> ≥ 0; reject the null hypothesis,,A
20,"Adele Chiesa is a money manager for the Bianco Fund. She is interested in recent findings showing that certain business condition variables predict excess US stock market returns (one-month market return minus one-month T-bill return). She is also familiar with evidence showing how US stock market returns differ by the political party affiliation of the US President. Chiesa estimates a multiple regression model to predict monthly excess stock market returns accounting for business conditions and the political party affiliation of the US President:Excess stock market returnt= a0+ a1Default spreadt–1+ a2Term spreadt–1+ a3Pres party dummyt–1+ etDefault spread is equal to the yield on Baa bonds minus the yield on Aaa bonds. Term spread is equal to the yield on a 10-year constant-maturity US Treasury index minus the yield on a 1-year constant-maturity US Treasury index. Pres party dummy is equal to 1 if the US President is a member of the Democratic Party and 0 if a member of the Republican Party.Chiesa collects 432 months of data (all data are in percent form, i.e., 0.01 = 1 percent). The regression is estimated with 431 observations because the independent variables are lagged one month. The regression output is in Exhibit 1. Exhibits 2 through 5 contain critical values for selected test statistics.

An intern working for Chiesa has a number of questions about the results in Exhibit 1:Question 1: How do you test to determine whether the overall regression model is significant?Question 2: Does the estimated model conform to standard regression assumptions? For instance, is the error term serially correlated, or is there conditional heteroskedasticity?Question 3: How do you interpret the coefficient for the Pres party dummy variable?Question 4: Default spread appears to be quite important. Is there some way to assess the precision of its estimated coefficient? What is the economic interpretation of this variable?After responding to her intern's questions, Chiesa concludes with the following statement: “Predictions from Exhibit 1 are subject to parameter estimate uncertainty, but not regression model uncertainty.”

21,"Alef Associates manages a long-only fund specializing in global smallcap equities. Since its founding a decade ago, Alef maintains a portfolio of 100 stocks (out of an eligible universe of about 10,000 stocks). Some of these holdings are the result of screening the universe for attractive stocks based on several ratios that use readily available market and accounting data; others are the result of investment ideas generated by Alef’s professional staff of five securities analysts and two portfolio managers.Although Alef’s investment performance has been good, its Chief Investment Officer, Paul Moresanu, is contemplating a change in the investment process aimed at achieving even better returns. After attending multiple workshops and being approached by data vendors, Moresanu feels that data science should play a role in the way Alef selects its investments. He has also noticed that much of Alef’s past outperformance is due to stocks that became takeover targets. After some research and reflection, Moresanu writes the following email to the Alef’s CEO.Subject: Investment Process ReorganizationI have been thinking about modernizing the way we select stock investments. Given that our past success has put Alef Associates in an excellent financial position, now seems to be a good time to invest in our future. What I propose is that we continue managing a portfolio of 100 global small-cap stocks but restructure our process to benefit from machine learning (ML). Importantly, the new process will still allow a role for human insight, for example, in providing domain knowledge. In addition, I think we should make a special effort to identify companies that are likely to be acquired. Specifically, I suggest following the four steps which would be repeated every quarter.Step 1 We apply ML techniques to a model including fundamental and technical variables (features) to predict next quarter’s return for each of the 100 stocks currently in our portfolio. Then, the 20 stocks with the lowest estimated return are identified for replacement.Step 2 We utilize ML techniques to divide our investable universe of about 10,000 stocks into 20 different groups, based on a wide variety of the most relevant financial and non-financial characteristics. The idea is to prevent unintended portfolio concentration by selecting stocks from each of these distinct groups.Step 3 For each of the 20 different groups, we use labeled data to train a model that will predict the five stocks (in any given group) that are most likely to become acquisition targets in the next one year.Step 4 Our five experienced securities analysts are each assigned four of the groups, and then each analyst selects their one best stock pick from each of their assigned groups. These 20 “high-conviction” stocks will be added to our portfolio (in replacement of the 20 relatively underperforming stocks to be sold in Step 1).A couple of additional comments related to the above:Comment 1 The ML algorithms will require large amounts of data. We would first need to explore using free or inexpensive historical datasets and then evaluate their usefulness for the ML-based stock selection processes before deciding on using data that requires subscription.Comment 2 As time passes, we expect to find additional ways to apply ML techniques to refine Alef’s investment processes.What do you think?Paul Moresanu

22,"Howard Golub, CFA, is preparing to write a research report on Stellar Energy Corp. common stock. One of the world’s largest companies, Stellar is in the business of refining and marketing oil. As part of his analysis, Golub wants to evaluate the sensitivity of the stock’s returns to various economic factors. For example, a client recently asked Golub whether the price of Stellar Energy Corp. stock has tended to rise following increases in retail energy prices. Golub believes the association between the two variables is negative, but he does not know the strength of the association.Golub directs his assistant, Jill Batten, to study the relationships between (1) Stellar monthly common stock returns and the previous month’s percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index for Energy (CPIENG) and (2) Stellar monthly common stock returns and the previous month’s percentage change in the US Producer Price Index for Crude Energy Materials (PPICEM). Golub wants Batten to run both a correlation and a linear regression analysis. In response, Batten compiles the summary statistics shown in Exhibit 1 for 248 months. All the data are in decimal form, where 0.01 indicates a 1% return. Batten also runs a regression analysis using Stellar monthly returns as the dependent variable and the monthly change in CPIENG as the independent variable. Exhibit 2 displays the results of this regression model.

26,"Aaliyah Schultz is a fixed-income portfolio manager at Aries Investments. Schultz supervises Ameris Steele, a junior analyst.A few years ago, Schultz developed a proprietary machine learning (ML) model that aims to predict downgrades of publicly-traded firms by bond rating agencies. The model currently relies only on structured financial data collected from different sources. Schultz thinks the model’s predictive power may be improved by incorporat-ing sentiment data derived from textual analysis of news articles and Twitter content relating to the subject companies.Schultz and Steele meet to discuss plans for incorporating the sentiment data into the model. They discuss the differences in the steps between building ML models that use traditional structured data and building ML models that use textual big data. Steele tells Schultz:Statement 1 The second step in building text-based ML models is text prepa-ration and wrangling, whereas the second step in building ML models using structured data is data collection.Statement 2 The fourth step in building both types of models encompasses data/text exploration.Steele expresses concern about using Twitter content in the model, noting that research suggests that as much as 10%–15% of social media content is from fake accounts. Schultz tells Steele that she understands her concern but thinks the potential for model improvement outweighs the concern.Steele begins building a model that combines the structured financial data and the sentiment data. She starts with cleansing and wrangling the raw structured financial data. Exhibit 1 presents a small sample of the raw dataset before cleansing: Each row represents data for a particular firm.
| Exhibit 1Sample of Raw Structured Data Before Cleansing |
| Industry | Interest |
| ID | Ticker | IPO Date | (NAICS) | EBIT | Expense | Total Debt |

| 4 | KLM | 14-Mar-15 | 72 | 5.7 | 1.5 | 0.0 |


After cleansing the data, Steele then preprocesses the dataset. She creates two new variables: an “Age” variable based on the firm’s IPO date and an “Interest Coverage Ratio” variable equal to EBIT divided by interest expense. She also deletes the “IPO Date” variable from the dataset. After applying these transformations, Steele scales the financial data using normalization. She notes that over the full sample dataset, the “Interest Expense” variable ranges from a minimum of 0.2 and a maximum of 12.2, with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of 0.4.Steele and Schultz then discuss how to preprocess the raw text data. Steele tells Schultz that the process can be completed in the following three steps:Step 1 Cleanse the raw text data.Step 2 Split the cleansed data into a collection of words for them to be normalized.Step 3 Normalize the collection of words from Step 2 and create a distinct set of tokens from the normalized words.With respect to Step 1, Steele tells Schultz:“I believe I should remove all html tags, punctuations, numbers, and extra white spaces from the data before normalizing them.”After properly cleansing the raw text data, Steele completes Steps 2 and 3. She then performs exploratory data analysis. To assist in feature selection, she wants to create a visualization that shows the most informative words in the dataset based on their term frequency (TF) values. After creating and analyzing the visualization, Steele is concerned that some tokens are likely to be noise features for ML model training; therefore, she wants to remove them.Steele and Schultz discuss the importance of feature selection and feature engi-neering in ML model training. Steele tells Schultz:“Appropriate feature selection is a key factor in minimizing model over-fitting, whereas feature engineering tends to prevent model underfitting.”Once satisfied with the final set of features, Steele selects and runs a model on the training set that classifies the text as having positive sentiment (Class “1” or negative sentiment (Class “0”). She then evaluates its performance using error analysis. The resulting confusion matrix is presented in Exhibit 2.

28,"Brad Varden, a junior analyst at an actively managed mutual fund, is responsible for research on a subset of the 500 large-cap equities the fund follows. Recently, the fund has been paying close attention to management turnover and to publicly available environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings. Varden is given the task of investigating whether any significant relationship exists between a company's profitability and either of these two characteristics. Colleen Quinni, a senior analyst at the fund, suggests that as an initial step in his investigation, Varden should perform a multiple regression analysis on the variables and report back to her.Varden knows that Quinni is an expert at quantitative research, and she once told Varden that after you get an idea, you should formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, and analyze the results. Varden expects to find that ESG rating is negatively related to ROE and CEO tenure is positively related to ROE. He considers a relationship meaningful when it is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. To begin, Varden collects values for ROE, CEO tenure, and ESG rating for a sample of 40 companies from the large-cap security universe. He performs a multiple regression with ROE (in percent) as the dependent variable and ESG rating and CEO tenure (in years) as the independent variables: Yi = b0 + b1X1i + b2X2i + εi.Exhibit 1 shows the regression results.

DF Associates is one of the companies Varden follows. He wants to predict its ROE using his regression model. DF Associates' corporate ESG rating is 55, and the company's CEO has been in that position for 10.5 years.Varden also wants to check on the relationship between these variables and the dividend growth rate (divgr), so he completes the correlation matrix shown in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Correlation Matrix |
| ROE | ESG | Tenure | Div gr |
| ROE | 1.0 |
| ESG | 0.446 | 1.0 |
| Tenure | 0.369 | 0.091 | 1.0 |
| Div gr | 0.117 | 0.046 | 0.028 | 1.0 |


Investigating further, Varden determines that dividend growth is not a linear combination of CEO tenure and ESG rating. He is unclear about how additional independent variables would affect the significance of the regression, so he asks Quinni, ""Given this correlation matrix, will both R2 and adjusted R2 automatically increase if I add dividend growth as a third independent variable?""The discussion continues, and Quinni asks two questions.1. What does your F-statistic of 4.161 tell you about the regression?2. In interpreting the overall significance of your regression model, which statistic do you believe is most relevant: R2, adjusted R2, or the F-statistic?Varden answers both questions correctly and says he wants to check two more ideas. He believes the following:1. ROE is less correlated with the dividend growth rate in firms whose CEO has been in office more than 15 years, and2. CEO tenure is a normally distributed random variable.Later, Varden includes the dividend growth rate as a third independent variable and runs the regression on the fund's entire group of 500 large-cap equities. He finds that the adjusted R2 is much higher than the results in Exhibit 1. He reports this to Quinni and says, “Adding the dividend growth rate gives a model with a higher adjusted R2. The three-variable model is clearly better.” Quinni cautions, ""I don't think you can conclude that yet.”
Varden's best answer to Quinni's question about overall significance is:",R<sup>2</sup>.,adjusted R<sup>2</sup>.,the F-statistic.,,C
29,"Howard Golub, CFA, is preparing to write a research report on Stellar Energy Corp. common stock. One of the world's largest companies, Stellar is in the business of refining and marketing oil. As part of his analysis, Golub wants to evaluate the sensitivity of the stock's returns to various economic factors. For example, a client recently asked Golub whether the price of Stellar Energy Corporation stock has tended to rise following increases in retail energy prices. Golub believes the association between the two variables to be negative, but he does not know the strength of the association.Golub directs his assistant, Jill Batten, to study the relationships between Stellar monthly common stock returns versus the previous month's percent change in the US Consumer Price Index for Energy (CPIENG), and Stellar monthly common stock returns versus the previous month's percent change in the US Producer Price Index for Crude Energy Materials (PPICEM). Golub wants Batten to run both a correlation and a linear regression analysis. In response, Batten compiles the summary statistics shown in Exhibit 1 for the 248 months between January 1980 and August 2000. All of the data are in decimal form, where 0.01 indicates a 1 percent return. Batten also runs a regression analysis using Stellar monthly returns as the dependent variable and the monthly change in CPIENG as the independent variable.

30,"Iesha Azarov is a senior analyst at Ganymede Moon Partners (Ganymede), where he works with junior analyst Pàola Bector. Azarov would like to incorporate machine learning (ML) models into the company’s analytical process. Azarov asks Bector to develop ML models for two unstructured stock sentiment datasets, Dataset ABC and Dataset XYZ. Both datasets have been cleaned and preprocessed in preparation for text exploration and model training.Following an exploratory data analysis that revealed Dataset ABC’s most frequent tokens, Bector conducts a collection frequency analysis. Bector then computes TF–IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) for several words in the collection and tells Azarov the following:Statement 1: IDF is equal to the inverse of the document frequency measure.Statement 2: TF at the collection level is multiplied by IDF to calculate TF–IDF.Statement 3: TF–IDF values vary by the number of documents in the dataset, and therefore, model performance can vary when applied to a dataset with just a few documents.Bector notes that Dataset ABC is characterized by the absence of ground truth.Bector turns his attention to Dataset XYZ, containing 84,000 tokens and 10,000 sentences. Bector chooses an appropriate feature selection method to identify and remove unnecessary tokens from the dataset and then focuses on model training. For performance evaluation purposes, Dataset XYZ is split into a training set, cross-validation (CV) set, and test set. Each of the sentences has already been labeled as either a positive sentiment (Class “1”) or a negative sentiment (Class “0”) sentence. There is an unequal class distribution between the positive sentiment and negative sentiment sentences in Dataset XYZ. Simple random sampling is applied within levels of the sentiment class labels to balance the class distributions within the splits. Bector’s view is that the false positive and false negative evaluation metrics should be given equal weight. Select performance data from the cross-validation set confusion matrices is presented in Exhibit 1:
| Exhibit 1Performance Metrics for Dataset XYZ |

Azarov and Bector evaluate the Dataset XYZ performance metrics for Confusion Matrices A, B, and C in Exhibit 1. Azarov says, “For Ganymede’s purposes, we should be most concerned with the cost of Type I errors.”Azarov requests that Bector apply the ML model to the test dataset for Dataset XYZ, assuming a threshold p-value of 0.65. Exhibit 2 contains a sample of results from the test dataset corpus.

33,"Angela Martinez, an energy sector analyst at an investment bank, is concerned about the future level of oil prices and how it might affect portfolio values. She is considering whether to recommend a hedge for the bank portfolio's exposure to changes in oil prices. Martinez examines West Texas Intermediate (WTI) monthly crude oil price data, expressed in US dollars per barrel, for the 181-month period from August 2000 through August 2015. The end-of-month WTI oil price was $51.16 in July 2015 and $42.86 in August 2015 (Month 181).After reviewing the time-series data, Martinez determines that the mean and variance of the time series of oil prices are not constant over time. She then runs the following four regressions using the WTI time-series data.Linear trend model: Oil pricet = b0 + b1t + etLog-linear trend model: In Oil pricet = b0 + b1t + etAR(1) model: Oil pricet = b0 + b1Oil pricet-1 + etAR(2) model: Oil pricet = b0 + b1Oil pricet-1 + b2Oil pricet-2 + etExhibit 1 presents selected data from all four regressions, and Exhibit 2 presents selected autocorrelation data from the AR(1) models.

In interpreting the overall significance of your regression model, which statistic do you believe is most relevant: R2, adjusted R2, or the F-statistic?Varden answers both questions correctly and says he wants to check two more ideas. He believes the following:1. ROE is less correlated with the dividend growth rate in firms whose CEO has been in office more than 15 years, and2. CEO tenure is a normally distributed random variable.Later, Varden includes the dividend growth rate as a third independent variable and runs the regression on the fund's entire group of 500 large-cap equities. He finds that the adjusted R2 is much higher than the results in Exhibit 1. He reports this to Quinni and says, “Adding the dividend growth rate gives a model with a higher adjusted R2. The three-variable model is clearly better.” Quinni cautions, ""I don't think you can conclude that yet.”
The best rationale for Quinni's caution about the three-variable model is that the:",dependent variable is defined differently.,sample sizes are different in the two models.,dividend growth rate is positively correlated with the other independent variables.,,B
35,"Alef Associates manages a long-only fund specializing in global smallcap equities. Since its founding a decade ago, Alef maintains a portfolio of 100 stocks (out of an eligible universe of about 10,000 stocks). Some of these holdings are the result of screening the universe for attractive stocks based on several ratios that use readily available market and accounting data; others are the result of investment ideas generated by Alef’s professional staff of five securities analysts and two portfolio managers.Although Alef’s investment performance has been good, its Chief Investment Officer, Paul Moresanu, is contemplating a change in the investment process aimed at achieving even better returns. After attending multiple workshops and being approached by data vendors, Moresanu feels that data science should play a role in the way Alef selects its investments. He has also noticed that much of Alef’s past outperformance is due to stocks that became takeover targets. After some research and reflection, Moresanu writes the following email to the Alef’s CEO.Subject: Investment Process ReorganizationI have been thinking about modernizing the way we select stock investments. Given that our past success has put Alef Associates in an excellent financial position, now seems to be a good time to invest in our future. What I propose is that we continue managing a portfolio of 100 global small-cap stocks but restructure our process to benefit from machine learning (ML). Importantly, the new process will still allow a role for human insight, for example, in providing domain knowledge. In addition, I think we should make a special effort to identify companies that are likely to be acquired. Specifically, I suggest following the four steps which would be repeated every quarter.Step 1 We apply ML techniques to a model including fundamental and technical variables (features) to predict next quarter’s return for each of the 100 stocks currently in our portfolio. Then, the 20 stocks with the lowest estimated return are identified for replacement.Step 2 We utilize ML techniques to divide our investable universe of about 10,000 stocks into 20 different groups, based on a wide variety of the most relevant financial and non-financial characteristics. The idea is to prevent unintended portfolio concentration by selecting stocks from each of these distinct groups.Step 3 For each of the 20 different groups, we use labeled data to train a model that will predict the five stocks (in any given group) that are most likely to become acquisition targets in the next one year.Step 4 Our five experienced securities analysts are each assigned four of the groups, and then each analyst selects their one best stock pick from each of their assigned groups. These 20 “high-conviction” stocks will be added to our portfolio (in replacement of the 20 relatively underperforming stocks to be sold in Step 1).A couple of additional comments related to the above:Comment 1 The ML algorithms will require large amounts of data. We would first need to explore using free or inexpensive historical datasets and then evaluate their usefulness for the ML-based stock selection processes before deciding on using data that requires subscription.Comment 2 As time passes, we expect to find additional ways to apply ML techniques to refine Alef’s investment processes.What do you think?Paul Moresanu

37,"Aaliyah Schultz is a fixed-income portfolio manager at Aries Investments. Schultz supervises Ameris Steele, a junior analyst.A few years ago, Schultz developed a proprietary machine learning (ML) model that aims to predict downgrades of publicly-traded firms by bond rating agencies. The model currently relies only on structured financial data collected from different sources. Schultz thinks the model’s predictive power may be improved by incorporating sentiment data derived from textual analysis of news articles and Twitter content relating to the subject companies.Schultz and Steele meet to discuss plans for incorporating the sentiment data into the model. They discuss the differences in the steps between building ML models that use traditional structured data and building ML models that use textual big data. Steele tells Schultz:Statement 1 The second step in building text-based ML models is text preparation and wrangling, whereas the second step in building ML models using structured data is data collection.Statement 2 The fourth step in building both types of models encompasses data/text exploration.Steele expresses concern about using Twitter content in the model, noting that research suggests that as much as 10%–15% of social media content is from fake accounts. Schultz tells Steele that she understands her concern but thinks the potential for model improvement outweighs the concern.Steele begins building a model that combines the structured financial data and the sentiment data. She starts with cleansing and wrangling the raw structured financial data. Exhibit 1 presents a small sample of the raw dataset before cleansing: Each row represents data for a particular firm.

She creates two new variables: an “Age” variable based on the firm’s IPO date and an “Interest Coverage Ratio” variable equal to EBIT divided by interest expense. She also deletes the “IPO Date” variable from the dataset. After applying these transformations, Steele scales the financial data using normalization. She notes that over the full sample dataset, the “Interest Expense” variable ranges from a minimum of 0.2 and a maximum of 12.2, with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of 0.4.Steele and Schultz then discuss how to preprocess the raw text data. Steele tells Schultz that the process can be completed in the following three steps:Step 1 Cleanse the raw text data.Step 2 Split the cleansed data into a collection of words for them to be normalized.Step 3 Normalize the collection of words from Step 2 and create a distinct set of tokens from the normalized words.With respect to Step 1, Steele tells Schultz:“I believe I should remove all html tags, punctuations, numbers, and extra white spaces from the data before normalizing them.”After properly cleansing the raw text data, Steele completes Steps 2 and 3. She then performs exploratory data analysis. To assist in feature selection, she wants to create a visualization that shows the most informative words in the dataset based on their term frequency (TF) values. After creating and analyzing the visualization, Steele is concerned that some tokens are likely to be noise features for ML model training; therefore, she wants to remove them.Steele and Schultz discuss the importance of feature selection and feature engineering in ML model training. Steele tells Schultz:“Appropriate feature selection is a key factor in minimizing model overfitting, whereas feature engineering tends to prevent model underfitting.”Once satisfied with the final set of features, Steele selects and runs a model on the training set that classifies the text as having positive sentiment (Class “1” or negative sentiment (Class “0”). She then evaluates its performance using error analysis. The resulting confusion matrix is presented in Exhibit 2.

38,"Anh Liu is an analyst researching whether a company’s debt burden affects investors’ decision to short the company’s stock. She calculates the short interest ratio (the ratio of short interest to average daily share volume, expressed in days) for 50 companies as of the end of 2016 and compares this ratio with the companies’ debt ratio (the ratio of total liabilities to total assets, expressed in decimal form).Liu provides a number of statistics in Exhibit 1. She also estimates a simple regression to investigate the effect of the debt ratio on a company’s short interest ratio. The results of this simple regression, including the analysis of variance (ANOVA), are shown in Exhibit 2.In addition to estimating a regression equation, Liu graphs the 50 observations using a scatter plot, with the short interest ratio on the vertical axis and the debt ratio on the horizontal axis.

40,"Alef Associates manages a long-only fund specializing in global smallcap equities. Since its founding a decade ago, Alef maintains a portfolio of 100 stocks (out of an eligible universe of about 10,000 stocks). Some of these holdings are the result of screening the universe for attractive stocks based on several ratios that use readily available market and accounting data; others are the result of investment ideas generated by Alef’s professional staff of five securities analysts and two portfolio managers.Although Alef’s investment performance has been good, its Chief Investment Officer, Paul Moresanu, is contemplating a change in the investment process aimed at achieving even better returns. After attending multiple workshops and being approached by data vendors, Moresanu feels that data science should play a role in the way Alef selects its investments. He has also noticed that much of Alef’s past outperformance is due to stocks that became takeover targets. After some research and reflection, Moresanu writes the following email to the Alef’s CEO.Subject: Investment Process ReorganizationI have been thinking about modernizing the way we select stock investments. Given that our past success has put Alef Associates in an excellent financial position, now seems to be a good time to invest in our future. What I propose is that we continue managing a portfolio of 100 global small-cap stocks but restructure our process to benefit from machine learning (ML). Importantly, the new process will still allow a role for human insight, for example, in providing domain knowledge. In addition, I think we should make a special effort to identify companies that are likely to be acquired. Specifically, I suggest following the four steps which would be repeated every quarter.Step 1 We apply ML techniques to a model including fundamental and technical variables (features) to predict next quarter’s return for each of the 100 stocks currently in our portfolio. Then, the 20 stocks with the lowest estimated return are identified for replacement.Step 2 We utilize ML techniques to divide our investable universe of about 10,000 stocks into 20 different groups, based on a wide variety of the most relevant financial and non-financial characteristics. The idea is to prevent unintended portfolio concentration by selecting stocks from each of these distinct groups.Step 3 For each of the 20 different groups, we use labeled data to train a model that will predict the five stocks (in any given group) that are most likely to become acquisition targets in the next one year.Step 4 Our five experienced securities analysts are each assigned four of the groups, and then each analyst selects their one best stock pick from each of their assigned groups. These 20 “high-conviction” stocks will be added to our portfolio (in replacement of the 20 relatively underperforming stocks to be sold in Step 1).A couple of additional comments related to the above:Comment 1 The ML algorithms will require large amounts of data. We would first need to explore using free or inexpensive historical datasets and then evaluate their usefulness for the ML-based stock selection processes before deciding on using data that requires subscription.Comment 2 As time passes, we expect to find additional ways to apply ML techniques to refine Alef’s investment processes.What do you think?Paul Moresanu

44,"Gary Hansen is a securities analyst for a mutual fund specializing in small-capitalization growth stocks. The fund regularly invests in initial public offerings (IPOs). If the fund subscribes to an offer, it is allocated shares at the offer price. Hansen notes that IPOs frequently are underpriced, and the price rises when open market trading begins. The initial return for an IPO is calculated as the change in price on the first day of trading divided by the offer price. Hansen is developing a regression model to predict the initial return for IPOs. Based on past research, he selects the following independent variables to predict IPO initial returns:
| Underwriter rank | = | 1-10， where 10is highest rank |
| Pre-offer price adjust men f |  | =(Offer price-Initial i ling price) /Inital filing price |
| Offer size($millions) | = | Shares sold x Offer price |

Hansen wants to use the regression results to predict the initial return for an upcoming IPO. The upcoming IPO has the following characteristics:■ underwriter rank = 6;■pre-offer price adjustment = 0.04;■offer size = $40 million;■fraction retained = 0.70.Because he notes that the pre-offer price adjustment appears to have an important effect on initial return, Hansen wants to construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the coefficient on this variable. He also believes that for each 1 percent increase in pre-offer price adjustment, the initial return will increase by less than 0.5 percent, holding other variables constant. Hansen wishes to test this hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance.Before applying his model, Hansen asks a colleague, Phil Chang, to review its specification and results. After examining the model, Chang concludes that the model suffers from two problems: 1) conditional heteroskedasticity, and 2) omitted variable bias. Chang makes the following statements:Statement 1: “Conditional heteroskedasticity will result in consistent coefficient estimates, but both the t-statistics and F-statistic will be biased, resulting in false inferences.”Statement 2: “If an omitted variable is correlated with variables already included in the model, coefficient estimates will be biased and inconsistent and standard errors will also be inconsistent.”Selected values for the t-distribution and F-distribution appear in Exhibits 3 and 4, respectively.

46,"Doris Honore is a securities analyst with a large wealth management firm. She and her colleague Bill Smith are addressing three research topics: how investment fund characteristics affect fund total returns, whether a fund rating system helps predict fund returns, and whether stock and bond market returns explain the returns of a portfolio of utility shares run by the firm.To explore the first topic, Honore decides to study US mutual funds using a sample of 555 large-cap US equity funds. The sample includes funds in style classes of value, growth, and blend (i.e., combining value and growth characteristics). The dependent variable is the average annualized rate of return (in percent) over the past five years. The independent variables are fund expense ratio, portfolio turnover, the natural logarithm of fund size, fund age, and three dummy variables. The multiple manager dummy variable has a value of 1 if the fund has multiple managers (and a value of 0 if it has a single manager). The fund style is indicated by a growth dummy (value of 1 for growth funds and 0 otherwise) and a blend dummy (value of 1 for blend funds and 0 otherwise). If the growth and blend dummies are both zero, the fund is a value fund. The regression output is given in Exhibit 1.

Based on the results shown in Exhibit 1, Honore wants to test the hypothesis that all of the regression coefficients are equal to zero. For the 555 fund sample, she also wants to compare the performance of growth funds with the value funds.Honore is concerned about the possible presence of multicollinearity in the regression. She states that adding a new independent variable that is highly correlated with one or more independent variables already in the regression model, has three potential consequences:1. The R2 is expected to decline.2. The regression coefficient estimates can become imprecise and unreliable.3. The standard errors for some or all of the regression coefficients will become inflated.Another concern for the regression model (in Exhibit 1) is conditional heteroskedasticity. Honore is concerned that the presence of heteroskedasticity can cause both the F-test for the overall significance of the regression and the t-tests for significance of individual regression coefficients to be unreliable. She runs a regression of the squared residuals from the model in Exhibit 1 on the eight independent variables, and finds the R2 is 0.0669.As a second research project, Honore wants to test whether including Morningstar's rating system, which assigns a one- through five-star rating to a fund, as an independent variable will improve the predictive power of the regression model. To do this, she needs to examine whether values of the independent variables in a given period predict fund return in the next period. Smith suggests three different methods of adding the Morningstar ratings to the model:■ Method 1: Add an independent variable that has a value equal to the number of stars in the rating of each fund.■Method 2: Add five dummy variables, one for each rating.■Method 3: Add dummy variables for four of the five ratings.As a third research project, Honore wants to establish whether bond market returns (proxied by returns of long-term US Treasuries) and stock market returns (proxied by returns of the S&P 500 Index) explain the returns of a portfolio of utility stocks being recommended to clients. Exhibit 2 presents the results of a regression of 10 years of monthly percentage total returns for the utility portfolio on monthly total returns for US Treasuries and the S&P 500.

For the time-series model in Exhibit 2, Honore says that positive serial correlation would not require that the estimated coefficients be adjusted, but that the standard errors of the regression coefficients would be underestimated. This issue would cause the t-statistics of the regression coefficients to be inflated. Honore tests the null hypothesis that the there is no serial correlation in the regression residuals and finds that the Durbin-Watson statistic is equal to 1.81. The critical values at the 0.05 significance level for the Durbin-Watson statistic are dl = 1.63 and du = 1.72.Smith asks whether Honore should have estimated the models in Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2 using a probit or logit model instead of using a traditional regression analysis.
Based on her estimated Durbin-Watson statistic, Honore should:",fail to reject the null hypothesis.,reject the null hypothesis because there is significant positive serial correlation.,reject the null hypothesis because there is significant negative serial correlation.,,A

She calculates the short interest ratio (the ratio of short interest to average daily share volume, expressed in days) for 50 companies as of the end of 2016 and compares this ratio with the companies' debt ratio (the ratio of total liabilities to total assets, expressed in decimal form).Liu provides a number of statistics in Exhibit 1. She also estimates a simple regression to investigate the effect of the debt ratio on a company's short interest ratio. The results of this simple regression, including the analysis of variance (ANOVA), are shown in Exhibit 2.In addition to estimating a regression equation, Liu graphs the 50 observations using a scatterplot, with the short interest ratio on the vertical axis and the debt ratio on the horizontal axis.

48,"Alef Associates manages a long-only fund specializing in global smallcap equities. Since its founding a decade ago, Alef maintains a portfolio of 100 stocks (out of an eligible universe of about 10,000 stocks). Some of these holdings are the result of screening the universe for attractive stocks based on several ratios that use readily available market and accounting data; others are the result of investment ideas generated by Alef’s professional staff of five securities analysts and two portfolio managers.Although Alef’s investment performance has been good, its Chief Investment Officer, Paul Moresanu, is contemplating a change in the investment process aimed at achieving even better returns. After attending multiple workshops and being approached by data vendors, Moresanu feels that data science should play a role in the way Alef selects its investments. He has also noticed that much of Alef’s past outperformance is due to stocks that became takeover targets. After some research and reflection, Moresanu writes the following email to the Alef’s CEO.Subject: Investment Process ReorganizationI have been thinking about modernizing the way we select stock investments. Given that our past success has put Alef Associates in an excellent financial position, now seems to be a good time to invest in our future. What I propose is that we continue managing a portfolio of 100 global small-cap stocks but restructure our process to benefit from machine learning (ML). Importantly, the new process will still allow a role for human insight, for example, in providing domain knowledge. In addition, I think we should make a special effort to identify companies that are likely to be acquired. Specifically, I suggest following the four steps which would be repeated every quarter.Step 1 We apply ML techniques to a model including fundamental and technical variables (features) to predict next quarter’s return for each of the 100 stocks currently in our portfolio. Then, the 20 stocks with the lowest estimated return are identified for replacement.Step 2 We utilize ML techniques to divide our investable universe of about 10,000 stocks into 20 different groups, based on a wide variety of the most relevant financial and non-financial characteristics. The idea is to prevent unintended portfolio concentration by selecting stocks from each of these distinct groups.Step 3 For each of the 20 different groups, we use labeled data to train a model that will predict the five stocks (in any given group) that are most likely to become acquisition targets in the next one year.Step 4 Our five experienced securities analysts are each assigned four of the groups, and then each analyst selects their one best stock pick from each of their assigned groups. These 20 “high-conviction” stocks will be added to our portfolio (in replacement of the 20 relatively underperforming stocks to be sold in Step 1).A couple of additional comments related to the above:Comment 1 The ML algorithms will require large amounts of data. We would first need to explore using free or inexpensive historical datasets and then evaluate their usefulness for the ML-based stock selection processes before deciding on using data that requires subscription.Comment 2 As time passes, we expect to find additional ways to apply ML techniques to refine Alef’s investment processes.What do you think?Paul Moresanu

50,"Gary Hansen is a securities analyst for a mutual fund specializing in small-capitalization growth stocks. The fund regularly invests in initial public offerings (IPOs). If the fund subscribes to an offer, it is allocated shares at the offer price. Hansen notes that IPOs frequently are underpriced, and the price rises when open market trading begins. The initial return for an IPO is calculated as the change in price on the first day of trading divided by the offer price. Hansen is developing a regression model to predict the initial return for IPOs. Based on past research, he selects the following independent variables to predict IPO initial returns:
| Underwriter rank | = | 1-10， where 10is highest rank |
| Pre-offer price adjust men f |  | =(Offer price-Initial i ling price) /Inital filing price |
| Offer size($millions) | = | Shares sold x Offer price |
| Fraction retained | = | Fraction of total company shares retained by insiders |


Hansen collects a sample of 1,725 recent IPOs for his regression model. Regression results appear in Exhibit 1, and ANOVA results appear in Exhibit 2.

Hansen wants to use the regression results to predict the initial return for an upcoming IPO. The upcoming IPO has the following characteristics:■ underwriter rank = 6;■pre-offer price adjustment = 0.04;■offer size = $40 million;■fraction retained = 0.70.Because he notes that the pre-offer price adjustment appears to have an important effect on initial return, Hansen wants to construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the coefficient on this variable. He also believes that for each 1 percent increase in pre-offer price adjustment, the initial return will increase by less than 0.5 percent, holding other variables constant. Hansen wishes to test this hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance.Before applying his model, Hansen asks a colleague, Phil Chang, to review its specification and results. After examining the model, Chang concludes that the model suffers from two problems: 1) conditional heteroskedasticity, and 2) omitted variable bias. Chang makes the following statements:Statement 1: “Conditional heteroskedasticity will result in consistent coefficient estimates, but both the t-statistics and F-statistic will be biased, resulting in false inferences.”Statement 2: “If an omitted variable is correlated with variables already included in the model, coefficient estimates will be biased and inconsistent and standard errors will also be inconsistent.”Selected values for the t-distribution and F-distribution appear in Exhibits 3 and 4, respectively.

51,"Aaliyah Schultz is a fixed-income portfolio manager at Aries Investments. Schultz supervises Ameris Steele, a junior analyst.A few years ago, Schultz developed a proprietary machine learning (ML) model that aims to predict downgrades of publicly-traded firms by bond rating agencies. The model currently relies only on structured financial data collected from different sources. Schultz thinks the model’s predictive power may be improved by incorporat-ing sentiment data derived from textual analysis of news articles and Twitter content relating to the subject companies.Schultz and Steele meet to discuss plans for incorporating the sentiment data into the model. They discuss the differences in the steps between building ML models that use traditional structured data and building ML models that use textual big data. Steele tells Schultz:Statement 1 The second step in building text-based ML models is text prepa-ration and wrangling, whereas the second step in building ML models using structured data is data collection.Statement 2 The fourth step in building both types of models encompasses data/text exploration.Steele expresses concern about using Twitter content in the model, noting that research suggests that as much as 10%–15% of social media content is from fake accounts. Schultz tells Steele that she understands her concern but thinks the potential for model improvement outweighs the concern.Steele begins building a model that combines the structured financial data and the sentiment data. She starts with cleansing and wrangling the raw structured financial data. Exhibit 1 presents a small sample of the raw dataset before cleansing: Each row represents data for a particular firm.

After cleansing the data, Steele then preprocesses the dataset. She creates two new variables: an “Age” variable based on the firm’s IPO date and an “Interest Coverage Ratio” variable equal to EBIT divided by interest expense. She also deletes the “IPO Date” variable from the dataset. After applying these transformations, Steele scales the financial data using normalization. She notes that over the full sample dataset, the “Interest Expense” variable ranges from a minimum of 0.2 and a maximum of 12.2, with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of 0.4.Steele and Schultz then discuss how to preprocess the raw text data. Steele tells Schultz that the process can be completed in the following three steps:Step 1 Cleanse the raw text data.Step 2 Split the cleansed data into a collection of words for them to be normalized.Step 3 Normalize the collection of words from Step 2 and create a distinct set of tokens from the normalized words.With respect to Step 1, Steele tells Schultz:“I believe I should remove all html tags, punctuations, numbers, and extra white spaces from the data before normalizing them.”After properly cleansing the raw text data, Steele completes Steps 2 and 3. She then performs exploratory data analysis. To assist in feature selection, she wants to create a visualization that shows the most informative words in the dataset based on their term frequency (TF) values. After creating and analyzing the visualization, Steele is concerned that some tokens are likely to be noise features for ML model training; therefore, she wants to remove them.Steele and Schultz discuss the importance of feature selection and feature engi-neering in ML model training. Steele tells Schultz:“Appropriate feature selection is a key factor in minimizing model over-fitting, whereas feature engineering tends to prevent model underfitting.”Once satisfied with the final set of features, Steele selects and runs a model on the training set that classifies the text as having positive sentiment (Class “1” or negative sentiment (Class “0”).

Both datasets have been cleaned and preprocessed in preparation for text exploration and model training.Following an exploratory data analysis that revealed Dataset ABC’s most frequent tokens, Bector conducts a collection frequency analysis. Bector then computes TF–IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) for several words in the collection and tells Azarov the following:Statement 1: IDF is equal to the inverse of the document frequency measure.Statement 2: TF at the collection level is multiplied by IDF to calculate TF–IDF.Statement 3: TF–IDF values vary by the number of documents in the dataset, and therefore, model performance can vary when applied to a dataset with just a few documents.Bector notes that Dataset ABC is characterized by the absence of ground truth.Bector turns his attention to Dataset XYZ, containing 84,000 tokens and 10,000 sentences. Bector chooses an appropriate feature selection method to identify and remove unnecessary tokens from the dataset and then focuses on model training. For performance evaluation purposes, Dataset XYZ is split into a training set, cross-validation (CV) set, and test set. Each of the sentences has already been labeled as either a positive sentiment (Class “1”) or a negative sentiment (Class “0”) sentence. There is an unequal class distribution between the positive sentiment and negative sentiment sentences in Dataset XYZ. Simple random sampling is applied within levels of the sentiment class labels to balance the class distributions within the splits. Bector’s view is that the false positive and false negative evaluation metrics should be given equal weight. Select performance data from the cross-validation set confusion matrices is presented in Exhibit 1:
| Exhibit 1Performance Metrics for Dataset XYZ |

| C | 0.65 | 0.86 | 0.97 | 0.92 | 0.91 |


Azarov and Bector evaluate the Dataset XYZ performance metrics for Confusion Matrices A, B, and C in Exhibit 1. Azarov says, “For Ganymede’s purposes, we should be most concerned with the cost of Type I errors.”Azarov requests that Bector apply the ML model to the test dataset for Dataset XYZ, assuming a threshold p-value of 0.65. Exhibit 2 contains a sample of results from the test dataset corpus.

Bector makes the following remarks regarding model training:Remark 1: Method selection is governed by such factors as the type of data and the size of data.Remark 2: In the performance evaluation stage, model fitting errors, such as bias error and variance error, are used to measure goodness of fit.

56,"Gary Hansen is a securities analyst for a mutual fund specializing in small-capitalization growth stocks. The fund regularly invests in initial public offerings (IPOs). If the fund subscribes to an offer, it is allocated shares at the offer price. Hansen notes that IPOs frequently are underpriced, and the price rises when open market trading begins. The initial return for an IPO is calculated as the change in price on the first day of trading divided by the offer price. Hansen is developing a regression model to predict the initial return for IPOs. Based on past research, he selects the following independent variables to predict IPO initial returns:
| Underwriter rank | = | 1-10， where 10is highest rank |
| Pre-offer price adjust men f |  | =(Offer price-Initial i ling price) /Inital filing price |
| Offer size($millions) | = | Shares sold x Offer price |
| Fraction retained | = | Fraction of total company shares retained by insiders |


Hansen collects a sample of 1,725 recent IPOs for his regression model. Regression results appear in Exhibit 1, and ANOVA results appear in Exhibit 2.

Hansen wants to use the regression results to predict the initial return for an upcoming IPO. The upcoming IPO has the following characteristics:■ underwriter rank = 6;■pre-offer price adjustment = 0.04;■offer size = $40 million;■fraction retained = 0.70.Because he notes that the pre-offer price adjustment appears to have an important effect on initial return, Hansen wants to construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the coefficient on this variable. He also believes that for each 1 percent increase in pre-offer price adjustment, the initial return will increase by less than 0.5 percent, holding other variables constant. Hansen wishes to test this hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance.Before applying his model, Hansen asks a colleague, Phil Chang, to review its specification and results. After examining the model, Chang concludes that the model suffers from two problems: 1) conditional heteroskedasticity, and 2) omitted variable bias. Chang makes the following statements:Statement 1: “Conditional heteroskedasticity will result in consistent coefficient estimates, but both the t-statistics and F-statistic will be biased, resulting in false inferences.”Statement 2: “If an omitted variable is correlated with variables already included in the model, coefficient estimates will be biased and inconsistent and standard errors will also be inconsistent.”Selected values for the t-distribution and F-distribution appear in Exhibits 3 and 4, respectively.

57,"Anh Liu is an analyst researching whether a company’s debt burden affects investors’ decision to short the company’s stock. She calculates the short interest ratio (the ratio of short interest to average daily share volume, expressed in days) for 50 companies as of the end of 2016 and compares this ratio with the companies’ debt ratio (the ratio of total liabilities to total assets, expressed in decimal form).Liu provides a number of statistics in Exhibit 1. She also estimates a simple regression to investigate the effect of the debt ratio on a company’s short interest ratio.

58,"Doris Honoré is a securities analyst with a large wealth management firm. She and her colleague Bill Smith are addressing three research topics: how investment fund characteristics affect fund total returns, whether a fund rating system helps predict fund returns, and whether stock and bond market returns explain the returns of a portfolio of utility shares run by the firm.To explore the first topic, Honoré decides to study US mutual funds using a sample of 555 large-cap US equity funds. The sample includes funds in style classes of value, growth, and blend (i.e., combining value and growth characteristics). The dependent variable is the average annualized rate of return (in percent) over the past five years. The independent variables are fund expense ratio, portfolio turnover, the natural logarithm of fund size, fund age, and three dummy variables. The multiple manager dummy variable has a value of 1 if the fund has multiple managers (and a value of 0 if it has a single manager). The fund style is indicated by a growth dummy (value of 1 for growth funds and 0 otherwise) and a blend dummy (value of 1 for blend funds and 0 otherwise). If the growth and blend dummies are both zero, the fund is a value fund. The regression output is given in Exhibit 1.

Based on the results shown in Exhibit 1, Honoré wants to test the hypothesis that all of the regression coefficients are equal to zero. For the 555 fund sample, she also wants to compare the performance of growth funds with the value funds.Honoré is concerned about the possible presence of multicollinearity in the regression. She states that adding a new independent variable that is highly correlated with one or more independent variables already in the regression model, has three potential consequences:1. The R2 is expected to decline.2. The regression coefficient estimates can become imprecise and unreliable.3. The standard errors for some or all of the regression coefficients will become inflated.Another concern for the regression model (in Exhibit 1) is conditional heteroskedasticity. Honoré is concerned that the presence of heteroskedasticity can cause both the F-test for the overall significance of the regression and the t-tests for significance of individual regression coefficients to be unreliable. She runs a regression of the squared residuals from the model in Exhibit 1 on the eight independent variables and finds the R2 is 0.0669.As a second research project, Honoré wants to test whether including Morningstar’s rating system, which assigns a one- through five-star rating to a fund, as an independent variable will improve the predictive power of the regression model. To do this, she needs to examine whether values of the independent variables in a given period predict fund return in the next period. Smith suggests three different methods of adding the Morningstar ratings to the model:Method 1: Add an independent variable that has a value equal to the number of stars in the rating of each fund.Method 2: Add five dummy variables, one for each rating.Method 3: Add dummy variables for four of the five ratings.As a third research project, Honoré wants to establish whether bond market returns (proxied by returns of long-term US Treasuries) and stock market returns (proxied by returns of the S&P 500 Index) explain the returns of a portfolio of utility stocks being recommended to clients. Exhibit 2 presents the results of a regression of 10 years of monthly percentage total returns for the utility portfolio on monthly total returns for US Treasuries and the S&P 500.

59,"Adele Chiesa is a money manager for the Bianco Fund. She is interested in recent findings showing that certain business condition variables predict excess US stock market returns (one-month market return minus one-month T-bill return). She is also familiar with evidence showing how US stock market returns differ by the political party affiliation of the US President. Chiesa estimates a multiple regression model to predict monthly excess stock market returns accounting for business conditions and the political party affiliation of the US President:Excess stock market returnt= a0+ a1Default spreadt–1+ a2Term spreadt–1+ a3Pres party dummyt–1+ etDefault spread is equal to the yield on Baa bonds minus the yield on Aaa bonds. Term spread is equal to the yield on a 10-year constant-maturity US Treasury index minus the yield on a 1-year constant-maturity US Treasury index. Pres party dummy is equal to 1 if the US President is a member of the Democratic Party and 0 if a member of the Republican Party.Chiesa collects 432 months of data (all data are in percent form, i.e., 0.01 = 1 percent).

An intern working for Chiesa has a number of questions about the results in Exhibit 1:Question 1: How do you test to determine whether the overall regression model is significant?Question 2: Does the estimated model conform to standard regression assumptions? For instance, is the error term serially correlated, or is there conditional heteroskedasticity?Question 3: How do you interpret the coefficient for the Pres party dummy variable?Question 4: Default spread appears to be quite important. Is there some way to assess the precision of its estimated coefficient? What is the economic interpretation of this variable?After responding to her intern's questions, Chiesa concludes with the following statement: “Predictions from Exhibit 1 are subject to parameter estimate uncertainty, but not regression model uncertainty.”

62,"Howard Golub, CFA, is preparing to write a research report on Stellar Energy Corp. common stock. One of the world's largest companies, Stellar is in the business of refining and marketing oil. As part of his analysis, Golub wants to evaluate the sensitivity of the stock's returns to various economic factors. For example, a client recently asked Golub whether the price of Stellar Energy Corporation stock has tended to rise following increases in retail energy prices. Golub believes the association between the two variables to be negative, but he does not know the strength of the association.Golub directs his assistant, Jill Batten, to study the relationships between Stellar monthly common stock returns versus the previous month's percent change in the US Consumer Price Index for Energy (CPIENG), and Stellar monthly common stock returns versus the previous month's percent change in the US Producer Price Index for Crude Energy Materials (PPICEM). Golub wants Batten to run both a correlation and a linear regression analysis. In response, Batten compiles the summary statistics shown in Exhibit 1 for the 248 months between January 1980 and August 2000. All of the data are in decimal form, where 0.01 indicates a 1 percent return.

63,"Doris Honore is a securities analyst with a large wealth management firm. She and her colleague Bill Smith are addressing three research topics: how investment fund characteristics affect fund total returns, whether a fund rating system helps predict fund returns, and whether stock and bond market returns explain the returns of a portfolio of utility shares run by the firm.To explore the first topic, Honore decides to study US mutual funds using a sample of 555 large-cap US equity funds. The sample includes funds in style classes of value, growth, and blend (i.e., combining value and growth characteristics). The dependent variable is the average annualized rate of return (in percent) over the past five years. The independent variables are fund expense ratio, portfolio turnover, the natural logarithm of fund size, fund age, and three dummy variables. The multiple manager dummy variable has a value of 1 if the fund has multiple managers (and a value of 0 if it has a single manager). The fund style is indicated by a growth dummy (value of 1 for growth funds and 0 otherwise) and a blend dummy (value of 1 for blend funds and 0 otherwise). If the growth and blend dummies are both zero, the fund is a value fund. The regression output is given in Exhibit 1.

Based on the results shown in Exhibit 1, Honore wants to test the hypothesis that all of the regression coefficients are equal to zero. For the 555 fund sample, she also wants to compare the performance of growth funds with the value funds.Honore is concerned about the possible presence of multicollinearity in the regression. She states that adding a new independent variable that is highly correlated with one or more independent variables already in the regression model, has three potential consequences:1. The R2 is expected to decline.2. The regression coefficient estimates can become imprecise and unreliable.3. The standard errors for some or all of the regression coefficients will become inflated.Another concern for the regression model (in Exhibit 1) is conditional heteroskedasticity. Honore is concerned that the presence of heteroskedasticity can cause both the F-test for the overall significance of the regression and the t-tests for significance of individual regression coefficients to be unreliable. She runs a regression of the squared residuals from the model in Exhibit 1 on the eight independent variables, and finds the R2 is 0.0669.As a second research project, Honore wants to test whether including Morningstar's rating system, which assigns a one- through five-star rating to a fund, as an independent variable will improve the predictive power of the regression model. To do this, she needs to examine whether values of the independent variables in a given period predict fund return in the next period. Smith suggests three different methods of adding the Morningstar ratings to the model:■ Method 1: Add an independent variable that has a value equal to the number of stars in the rating of each fund.■Method 2: Add five dummy variables, one for each rating.■Method 3: Add dummy variables for four of the five ratings.As a third research project, Honore wants to establish whether bond market returns (proxied by returns of long-term US Treasuries) and stock market returns (proxied by returns of the S&P 500 Index) explain the returns of a portfolio of utility stocks being recommended to clients. Exhibit 2 presents the results of a regression of 10 years of monthly percentage total returns for the utility portfolio on monthly total returns for US Treasuries and the S&P 500.

For the time-series model in Exhibit 2, Honore says that positive serial correlation would not require that the estimated coefficients be adjusted, but that the standard errors of the regression coefficients would be underestimated. This issue would cause the t-statistics of the regression coefficients to be inflated. Honore tests the null hypothesis that the there is no serial correlation in the regression residuals and finds that the Durbin-Watson statistic is equal to 1.81. The critical values at the 0.05 significance level for the Durbin-Watson statistic are dl = 1.63 and du = 1.72.Smith asks whether Honore should have estimated the models in Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2 using a probit or logit model instead of using a traditional regression analysis.

65,"Howard Golub, CFA, is preparing to write a research report on Stellar Energy Corp. common stock. One of the world’s largest companies, Stellar is in the business of refining and marketing oil. As part of his analysis, Golub wants to evaluate the sensitivity of the stock’s returns to various economic factors. For example, a client recently asked Golub whether the price of Stellar Energy Corp. stock has tended to rise following increases in retail energy prices. Golub believes the association between the two variables is negative, but he does not know the strength of the association.Golub directs his assistant, Jill Batten, to study the relationships between (1) Stellar monthly common stock returns and the previous month’s percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index for Energy (CPIENG) and (2) Stellar monthly common stock returns and the previous month’s percentage change in the US Producer Price Index for Crude Energy Materials (PPICEM). Golub wants Batten to run both a correlation and a linear regression analysis. In response, Batten compiles the summary statistics shown in Exhibit 1 for 248 months. All the data are in decimal form, where 0.01 indicates a 1% return. Batten also runs a regression analysis using Stellar monthly returns as the dependent variable and the monthly change in CPIENG as the independent variable. Exhibit 2 displays the results of this regression model.

She calculates the short interest ratio (the ratio of short interest to average daily share volume, expressed in days) for 50 companies as of the end of 2016 and compares this ratio with the companies' debt ratio (the ratio of total liabilities to total assets, expressed in decimal form).Liu provides a number of statistics in Exhibit 1. She also estimates a simple regression to investigate the effect of the debt ratio on a company's short interest ratio. The results of this simple regression, including the analysis of variance (ANOVA), are shown in Exhibit 2.In addition to estimating a regression equation, Liu graphs the 50 observations using a scatterplot, with the short interest ratio on the vertical axis and the debt ratio on the horizontal axis.

67,"Aaliyah Schultz is a fixed-income portfolio manager at Aries Investments. Schultz supervises Ameris Steele, a junior analyst.A few years ago, Schultz developed a proprietary machine learning (ML) model that aims to predict downgrades of publicly-traded firms by bond rating agencies. The model currently relies only on structured financial data collected from different sources. Schultz thinks the model’s predictive power may be improved by incorporat-ing sentiment data derived from textual analysis of news articles and Twitter content relating to the subject companies.Schultz and Steele meet to discuss plans for incorporating the sentiment data into the model. They discuss the differences in the steps between building ML models that use traditional structured data and building ML models that use textual big data. Steele tells Schultz:Statement 1 The second step in building text-based ML models is text prepa-ration and wrangling, whereas the second step in building ML models using structured data is data collection.Statement 2 The fourth step in building both types of models encompasses data/text exploration.Steele expresses concern about using Twitter content in the model, noting that research suggests that as much as 10%–15% of social media content is from fake accounts. Schultz tells Steele that she understands her concern but thinks the potential for model improvement outweighs the concern.Steele begins building a model that combines the structured financial data and the sentiment data. She starts with cleansing and wrangling the raw structured financial data. Exhibit 1 presents a small sample of the raw dataset before cleansing: Each row represents data for a particular firm.

After cleansing the data, Steele then preprocesses the dataset. She creates two new variables: an “Age” variable based on the firm’s IPO date and an “Interest Coverage Ratio” variable equal to EBIT divided by interest expense. She also deletes the “IPO Date” variable from the dataset. After applying these transformations, Steele scales the financial data using normalization. She notes that over the full sample dataset, the “Interest Expense” variable ranges from a minimum of 0.2 and a maximum of 12.2, with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of 0.4.Steele and Schultz then discuss how to preprocess the raw text data. Steele tells Schultz that the process can be completed in the following three steps:Step 1 Cleanse the raw text data.Step 2 Split the cleansed data into a collection of words for them to be normalized.Step 3 Normalize the collection of words from Step 2 and create a distinct set of tokens from the normalized words.With respect to Step 1, Steele tells Schultz:“I believe I should remove all html tags, punctuations, numbers, and extra white spaces from the data before normalizing them.”After properly cleansing the raw text data, Steele completes Steps 2 and 3. She then performs exploratory data analysis. To assist in feature selection, she wants to create a visualization that shows the most informative words in the dataset based on their term frequency (TF) values. After creating and analyzing the visualization, Steele is concerned that some tokens are likely to be noise features for ML model training; therefore, she wants to remove them.Steele and Schultz discuss the importance of feature selection and feature engi-neering in ML model training. Steele tells Schultz:“Appropriate feature selection is a key factor in minimizing model over-fitting, whereas feature engineering tends to prevent model underfitting.”Once satisfied with the final set of features, Steele selects and runs a model on the training set that classifies the text as having positive sentiment (Class “1” or negative sentiment (Class “0”). She then evaluates its performance using error analysis. The resulting confusion matrix is presented in Exhibit 2.

68,"Iesha Azarov is a senior analyst at Ganymede Moon Partners (Ganymede), where he works with junior analyst Pàola Bector. Azarov would like to incorporate machine learning (ML) models into the company’s analytical process. Azarov asks Bector to develop ML models for two unstructured stock sentiment datasets, Dataset ABC and Dataset XYZ. Both datasets have been cleaned and preprocessed in preparation for text exploration and model training.Following an exploratory data analysis that revealed Dataset ABC’s most frequent tokens, Bector conducts a collection frequency analysis. Bector then computes TF–IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) for several words in the collection and tells Azarov the following:Statement 1: IDF is equal to the inverse of the document frequency measure.Statement 2: TF at the collection level is multiplied by IDF to calculate TF–IDF.Statement 3: TF–IDF values vary by the number of documents in the dataset, and therefore, model performance can vary when applied to a dataset with just a few documents.Bector notes that Dataset ABC is characterized by the absence of ground truth.Bector turns his attention to Dataset XYZ, containing 84,000 tokens and 10,000 sentences. Bector chooses an appropriate feature selection method to identify and remove unnecessary tokens from the dataset and then focuses on model training. For performance evaluation purposes, Dataset XYZ is split into a training set, cross-validation (CV) set, and test set. Each of the sentences has already been labeled as either a positive sentiment (Class “1”) or a negative sentiment (Class “0”) sentence. There is an unequal class distribution between the positive sentiment and negative sentiment sentences in Dataset XYZ. Simple random sampling is applied within levels of the sentiment class labels to balance the class distributions within the splits. Bector’s view is that the false positive and false negative evaluation metrics should be given equal weight. Select performance data from the cross-validation set confusion matrices is presented in Exhibit 1:

69,"Gary Hansen is a securities analyst for a mutual fund specializing in small-capitalization growth stocks. The fund regularly invests in initial public offerings (IPOs). If the fund subscribes to an offer, it is allocated shares at the offer price. Hansen notes that IPOs frequently are underpriced, and the price rises when open market trading begins. The initial return for an IPO is calculated as the change in price on the first day of trading divided by the offer price. Hansen is developing a regression model to predict the initial return for IPOs. Based on past research, he selects the following independent variables to predict IPO initial returns:
| Underwriter rank | = | 1-10， where 10is highest rank |
| Pre-offer price adjust men f |  | =(Offer price-Initial i ling price) /Inital filing price |
| Offer size($millions) | = | Shares sold x Offer price |

Hansen wants to use the regression results to predict the initial return for an upcoming IPO. The upcoming IPO has the following characteristics:■ underwriter rank = 6;■pre-offer price adjustment = 0.04;■offer size = $40 million;■fraction retained = 0.70.Because he notes that the pre-offer price adjustment appears to have an important effect on initial return, Hansen wants to construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the coefficient on this variable. He also believes that for each 1 percent increase in pre-offer price adjustment, the initial return will increase by less than 0.5 percent, holding other variables constant. Hansen wishes to test this hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance.Before applying his model, Hansen asks a colleague, Phil Chang, to review its specification and results. After examining the model, Chang concludes that the model suffers from two problems: 1) conditional heteroskedasticity, and 2) omitted variable bias. Chang makes the following statements:Statement 1: “Conditional heteroskedasticity will result in consistent coefficient estimates, but both the t-statistics and F-statistic will be biased, resulting in false inferences.”Statement 2: “If an omitted variable is correlated with variables already included in the model, coefficient estimates will be biased and inconsistent and standard errors will also be inconsistent.”Selected values for the t-distribution and F-distribution appear in Exhibits 3 and 4, respectively.

74,"Aaliyah Schultz is a fixed-income portfolio manager at Aries Investments. Schultz supervises Ameris Steele, a junior analyst.A few years ago, Schultz developed a proprietary machine learning (ML) model that aims to predict downgrades of publicly-traded firms by bond rating agencies. The model currently relies only on structured financial data collected from different sources. Schultz thinks the model’s predictive power may be improved by incorporat-ing sentiment data derived from textual analysis of news articles and Twitter content relating to the subject companies.Schultz and Steele meet to discuss plans for incorporating the sentiment data into the model. They discuss the differences in the steps between building ML models that use traditional structured data and building ML models that use textual big data. Steele tells Schultz:Statement 1 The second step in building text-based ML models is text prepa-ration and wrangling, whereas the second step in building ML models using structured data is data collection.Statement 2 The fourth step in building both types of models encompasses data/text exploration.Steele expresses concern about using Twitter content in the model, noting that research suggests that as much as 10%–15% of social media content is from fake accounts. Schultz tells Steele that she understands her concern but thinks the potential for model improvement outweighs the concern.Steele begins building a model that combines the structured financial data and the sentiment data. She starts with cleansing and wrangling the raw structured financial data. Exhibit 1 presents a small sample of the raw dataset before cleansing: Each row represents data for a particular firm.

After cleansing the data, Steele then preprocesses the dataset. She creates two new variables: an “Age” variable based on the firm’s IPO date and an “Interest Coverage Ratio” variable equal to EBIT divided by interest expense. She also deletes the “IPO Date” variable from the dataset. After applying these transformations, Steele scales the financial data using normalization. She notes that over the full sample dataset, the “Interest Expense” variable ranges from a minimum of 0.2 and a maximum of 12.2, with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of 0.4.Steele and Schultz then discuss how to preprocess the raw text data. Steele tells Schultz that the process can be completed in the following three steps:Step 1 Cleanse the raw text data.Step 2 Split the cleansed data into a collection of words for them to be normalized.Step 3 Normalize the collection of words from Step 2 and create a distinct set of tokens from the normalized words.With respect to Step 1, Steele tells Schultz:“I believe I should remove all html tags, punctuations, numbers, and extra white spaces from the data before normalizing them.”After properly cleansing the raw text data, Steele completes Steps 2 and 3. She then performs exploratory data analysis. To assist in feature selection, she wants to create a visualization that shows the most informative words in the dataset based on their term frequency (TF) values. After creating and analyzing the visualization, Steele is concerned that some tokens are likely to be noise features for ML model training; therefore, she wants to remove them.Steele and Schultz discuss the importance of feature selection and feature engi-neering in ML model training. Steele tells Schultz:“Appropriate feature selection is a key factor in minimizing model over-fitting, whereas feature engineering tends to prevent model underfitting.”Once satisfied with the final set of features, Steele selects and runs a model on the training set that classifies the text as having positive sentiment (Class “1” or negative sentiment (Class “0”). She then evaluates its performance using error analysis. The resulting confusion matrix is presented in Exhibit 2.

75,"Brad Varden, a junior analyst at an actively managed mutual fund, is responsible for research on a subset of the 500 large-cap equities the fund follows. Recently, the fund has been paying close attention to management turnover and to publicly available environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings. Varden is given the task of investigating whether any significant relationship exists between a company's profitability and either of these two characteristics. Colleen Quinni, a senior analyst at the fund, suggests that as an initial step in his investigation, Varden should perform a multiple regression analysis on the variables and report back to her.Varden knows that Quinni is an expert at quantitative research, and she once told Varden that after you get an idea, you should formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, and analyze the results. Varden expects to find that ESG rating is negatively related to ROE and CEO tenure is positively related to ROE. He considers a relationship meaningful when it is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. To begin, Varden collects values for ROE, CEO tenure, and ESG rating for a sample of 40 companies from the large-cap security universe. He performs a multiple regression with ROE (in percent) as the dependent variable and ESG rating and CEO tenure (in years) as the independent variables: Yi = b0 + b1X1i + b2X2i + εi.Exhibit 1 shows the regression results.

DF Associates is one of the companies Varden follows. He wants to predict its ROE using his regression model. DF Associates' corporate ESG rating is 55, and the company's CEO has been in that position for 10.5 years.Varden also wants to check on the relationship between these variables and the dividend growth rate (divgr), so he completes the correlation matrix shown in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Correlation Matrix |
| ROE | ESG | Tenure | Div gr |
| ROE | 1.0 |
| ESG | 0.446 | 1.0 |
| Tenure | 0.369 | 0.091 | 1.0 |
| Div gr | 0.117 | 0.046 | 0.028 | 1.0 |


Investigating further, Varden determines that dividend growth is not a linear combination of CEO tenure and ESG rating. He is unclear about how additional independent variables would affect the significance of the regression, so he asks Quinni, ""Given this correlation matrix, will both R2 and adjusted R2 automatically increase if I add dividend growth as a third independent variable?""The discussion continues, and Quinni asks two questions.1. What does your F-statistic of 4.161 tell you about the regression?2. In interpreting the overall significance of your regression model, which statistic do you believe is most relevant: R2, adjusted R2, or the F-statistic?Varden answers both questions correctly and says he wants to check two more ideas. He believes the following:1. ROE is less correlated with the dividend growth rate in firms whose CEO has been in office more than 15 years, and2. CEO tenure is a normally distributed random variable.Later, Varden includes the dividend growth rate as a third independent variable and runs the regression on the fund's entire group of 500 large-cap equities. He finds that the adjusted R2 is much higher than the results in Exhibit 1. He reports this to Quinni and says, “Adding the dividend growth rate gives a model with a higher adjusted R2. The three-variable model is clearly better.” Quinni cautions, ""I don't think you can conclude that yet.”

77,"Alef Associates manages a long-only fund specializing in global smallcap equities. Since its founding a decade ago, Alef maintains a portfolio of 100 stocks (out of an eligible universe of about 10,000 stocks). Some of these holdings are the result of screening the universe for attractive stocks based on several ratios that use readily available market and accounting data; others are the result of investment ideas generated by Alef’s professional staff of five securities analysts and two portfolio managers.Although Alef’s investment performance has been good, its Chief Investment Officer, Paul Moresanu, is contemplating a change in the investment process aimed at achieving even better returns. After attending multiple workshops and being approached by data vendors, Moresanu feels that data science should play a role in the way Alef selects its investments. He has also noticed that much of Alef’s past outperformance is due to stocks that became takeover targets. After some research and reflection, Moresanu writes the following email to the Alef’s CEO.Subject: Investment Process ReorganizationI have been thinking about modernizing the way we select stock investments. Given that our past success has put Alef Associates in an excellent financial position, now seems to be a good time to invest in our future. What I propose is that we continue managing a portfolio of 100 global small-cap stocks but restructure our process to benefit from machine learning (ML). Importantly, the new process will still allow a role for human insight, for example, in providing domain knowledge. In addition, I think we should make a special effort to identify companies that are likely to be acquired. Specifically, I suggest following the four steps which would be repeated every quarter.Step 1 We apply ML techniques to a model including fundamental and technical variables (features) to predict next quarter’s return for each of the 100 stocks currently in our portfolio. Then, the 20 stocks with the lowest estimated return are identified for replacement.Step 2 We utilize ML techniques to divide our investable universe of about 10,000 stocks into 20 different groups, based on a wide variety of the most relevant financial and non-financial characteristics. The idea is to prevent unintended portfolio concentration by selecting stocks from each of these distinct groups.Step 3 For each of the 20 different groups, we use labeled data to train a model that will predict the five stocks (in any given group) that are most likely to become acquisition targets in the next one year.Step 4 Our five experienced securities analysts are each assigned four of the groups, and then each analyst selects their one best stock pick from each of their assigned groups. These 20 “high-conviction” stocks will be added to our portfolio (in replacement of the 20 relatively underperforming stocks to be sold in Step 1).A couple of additional comments related to the above:Comment 1 The ML algorithms will require large amounts of data. We would first need to explore using free or inexpensive historical datasets and then evaluate their usefulness for the ML-based stock selection processes before deciding on using data that requires subscription.Comment 2 As time passes, we expect to find additional ways to apply ML techniques to refine Alef’s investment processes.What do you think?Paul Moresanu

78,"Adele Chiesa is a money manager for the Bianco Fund. She is interested in recent findings showing that certain business condition variables predict excess US stock market returns (one-month market return minus one-month T-bill return). She is also familiar with evidence showing how US stock market returns differ by the political party affiliation of the US President. Chiesa estimates a multiple regression model to predict monthly excess stock market returns accounting for business conditions and the political party affiliation of the US President:Excess stock market returnt= a0+ a1Default spreadt–1+ a2Term spreadt–1+ a3Pres party dummyt–1+ etDefault spread is equal to the yield on Baa bonds minus the yield on Aaa bonds. Term spread is equal to the yield on a 10-year constant-maturity US Treasury index minus the yield on a 1-year constant-maturity US Treasury index. Pres party dummy is equal to 1 if the US President is a member of the Democratic Party and 0 if a member of the Republican Party.Chiesa collects 432 months of data (all data are in percent form, i.e., 0.01 = 1 percent).

82,"Gary Hansen is a securities analyst for a mutual fund specializing in small-capitalization growth stocks. The fund regularly invests in initial public offerings (IPOs). If the fund subscribes to an offer, it is allocated shares at the offer price. Hansen notes that IPOs frequently are underpriced, and the price rises when open market trading begins. The initial return for an IPO is calculated as the change in price on the first day of trading divided by the offer price. Hansen is developing a regression model to predict the initial return for IPOs. Based on past research, he selects the following independent variables to predict IPO initial returns:
| Underwriter rank | = | 1-10， where 10is highest rank |
| Pre-offer price adjust men f |  | =(Offer price-Initial i ling price) /Inital filing price |

Hansen wants to use the regression results to predict the initial return for an upcoming IPO. The upcoming IPO has the following characteristics:■ underwriter rank = 6;■pre-offer price adjustment = 0.04;■offer size = $40 million;■fraction retained = 0.70.Because he notes that the pre-offer price adjustment appears to have an important effect on initial return, Hansen wants to construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the coefficient on this variable. He also believes that for each 1 percent increase in pre-offer price adjustment, the initial return will increase by less than 0.5 percent, holding other variables constant. Hansen wishes to test this hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance.Before applying his model, Hansen asks a colleague, Phil Chang, to review its specification and results. After examining the model, Chang concludes that the model suffers from two problems: 1) conditional heteroskedasticity, and 2) omitted variable bias. Chang makes the following statements:Statement 1: “Conditional heteroskedasticity will result in consistent coefficient estimates, but both the t-statistics and F-statistic will be biased, resulting in false inferences.”Statement 2: “If an omitted variable is correlated with variables already included in the model, coefficient estimates will be biased and inconsistent and standard errors will also be inconsistent.”Selected values for the t-distribution and F-distribution appear in Exhibits 3 and 4, respectively.

Schultz supervises Ameris Steele, a junior analyst.A few years ago, Schultz developed a proprietary machine learning (ML) model that aims to predict downgrades of publicly-traded firms by bond rating agencies. The model currently relies only on structured financial data collected from different sources. Schultz thinks the model’s predictive power may be improved by incorporat-ing sentiment data derived from textual analysis of news articles and Twitter content relating to the subject companies.Schultz and Steele meet to discuss plans for incorporating the sentiment data into the model. They discuss the differences in the steps between building ML models that use traditional structured data and building ML models that use textual big data. Steele tells Schultz:Statement 1 The second step in building text-based ML models is text prepa-ration and wrangling, whereas the second step in building ML models using structured data is data collection.Statement 2 The fourth step in building both types of models encompasses data/text exploration.Steele expresses concern about using Twitter content in the model, noting that research suggests that as much as 10%–15% of social media content is from fake accounts. Schultz tells Steele that she understands her concern but thinks the potential for model improvement outweighs the concern.Steele begins building a model that combines the structured financial data and the sentiment data. She starts with cleansing and wrangling the raw structured financial data. Exhibit 1 presents a small sample of the raw dataset before cleansing: Each row represents data for a particular firm.

After cleansing the data, Steele then preprocesses the dataset. She creates two new variables: an “Age” variable based on the firm’s IPO date and an “Interest Coverage Ratio” variable equal to EBIT divided by interest expense. She also deletes the “IPO Date” variable from the dataset. After applying these transformations, Steele scales the financial data using normalization. She notes that over the full sample dataset, the “Interest Expense” variable ranges from a minimum of 0.2 and a maximum of 12.2, with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of 0.4.Steele and Schultz then discuss how to preprocess the raw text data. Steele tells Schultz that the process can be completed in the following three steps:Step 1 Cleanse the raw text data.Step 2 Split the cleansed data into a collection of words for them to be normalized.Step 3 Normalize the collection of words from Step 2 and create a distinct set of tokens from the normalized words.With respect to Step 1, Steele tells Schultz:“I believe I should remove all html tags, punctuations, numbers, and extra white spaces from the data before normalizing them.”After properly cleansing the raw text data, Steele completes Steps 2 and 3. She then performs exploratory data analysis. To assist in feature selection, she wants to create a visualization that shows the most informative words in the dataset based on their term frequency (TF) values. After creating and analyzing the visualization, Steele is concerned that some tokens are likely to be noise features for ML model training; therefore, she wants to remove them.Steele and Schultz discuss the importance of feature selection and feature engi-neering in ML model training. Steele tells Schultz:“Appropriate feature selection is a key factor in minimizing model over-fitting, whereas feature engineering tends to prevent model underfitting.”Once satisfied with the final set of features, Steele selects and runs a model on the training set that classifies the text as having positive sentiment (Class “1” or negative sentiment (Class “0”). She then evaluates its performance using error analysis. The resulting confusion matrix is presented in Exhibit 2.

84,"Brad Varden, a junior analyst at an actively managed mutual fund, is responsible for research on a subset of the 500 large-cap equities the fund follows. Recently, the fund has been paying close attention to management turnover and to publicly available environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings. Varden is given the task of investigating whether any significant relationship exists between a company's profitability and either of these two characteristics. Colleen Quinni, a senior analyst at the fund, suggests that as an initial step in his investigation, Varden should perform a multiple regression analysis on the variables and report back to her.Varden knows that Quinni is an expert at quantitative research, and she once told Varden that after you get an idea, you should formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, and analyze the results. Varden expects to find that ESG rating is negatively related to ROE and CEO tenure is positively related to ROE. He considers a relationship meaningful when it is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. To begin, Varden collects values for ROE, CEO tenure, and ESG rating for a sample of 40 companies from the large-cap security universe. He performs a multiple regression with ROE (in percent) as the dependent variable and ESG rating and CEO tenure (in years) as the independent variables: Yi = b0 + b1X1i + b2X2i + εi.Exhibit 1 shows the regression results.

DF Associates is one of the companies Varden follows. He wants to predict its ROE using his regression model. DF Associates' corporate ESG rating is 55, and the company's CEO has been in that position for 10.5 years.Varden also wants to check on the relationship between these variables and the dividend growth rate (divgr), so he completes the correlation matrix shown in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Correlation Matrix |
| ROE | ESG | Tenure | Div gr |
| ROE | 1.0 |
| ESG | 0.446 | 1.0 |
| Tenure | 0.369 | 0.091 | 1.0 |
| Div gr | 0.117 | 0.046 | 0.028 | 1.0 |


Investigating further, Varden determines that dividend growth is not a linear combination of CEO tenure and ESG rating. He is unclear about how additional independent variables would affect the significance of the regression, so he asks Quinni, ""Given this correlation matrix, will both R2 and adjusted R2 automatically increase if I add dividend growth as a third independent variable?""The discussion continues, and Quinni asks two questions.1. What does your F-statistic of 4.161 tell you about the regression?2. In interpreting the overall significance of your regression model, which statistic do you believe is most relevant: R2, adjusted R2, or the F-statistic?Varden answers both questions correctly and says he wants to check two more ideas. He believes the following:1. ROE is less correlated with the dividend growth rate in firms whose CEO has been in office more than 15 years, and2. CEO tenure is a normally distributed random variable.Later, Varden includes the dividend growth rate as a third independent variable and runs the regression on the fund's entire group of 500 large-cap equities. He finds that the adjusted R2 is much higher than the results in Exhibit 1. He reports this to Quinni and says, “Adding the dividend growth rate gives a model with a higher adjusted R2. The three-variable model is clearly better.” Quinni cautions, ""I don't think you can conclude that yet.”
At a significance level of 1%, which of the following is the best interpretation of the regression coefficients with regard to explaining ROE?","ESG is significant, but tenure is not.","Tenure is significant, but ESG is not.",Neither ESG nor tenure is significant.,,C
85,"Howard Golub, CFA, is preparing to write a research report on Stellar Energy Corp. common stock. One of the world’s largest companies, Stellar is in the business of refining and marketing oil. As part of his analysis, Golub wants to evaluate the sensitivity of the stock’s returns to various economic factors. For example, a client recently asked Golub whether the price of Stellar Energy Corp. stock has tended to rise following increases in retail energy prices. Golub believes the association between the two variables is negative, but he does not know the strength of the association.Golub directs his assistant, Jill Batten, to study the relationships between (1) Stellar monthly common stock returns and the previous month’s percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index for Energy (CPIENG) and (2) Stellar monthly common stock returns and the previous month’s percentage change in the US Producer Price Index for Crude Energy Materials (PPICEM). Golub wants Batten to run both a correlation and a linear regression analysis. In response, Batten compiles the summary statistics shown in Exhibit 1 for 248 months. All the data are in decimal form, where 0.01 indicates a 1% return. Batten also runs a regression analysis using Stellar monthly returns as the dependent variable and the monthly change in CPIENG as the independent variable.

89,"Doris Honoré is a securities analyst with a large wealth management firm. She and her colleague Bill Smith are addressing three research topics: how investment fund characteristics affect fund total returns, whether a fund rating system helps predict fund returns, and whether stock and bond market returns explain the returns of a portfolio of utility shares run by the firm.To explore the first topic, Honoré decides to study US mutual funds using a sample of 555 large-cap US equity funds. The sample includes funds in style classes of value, growth, and blend (i.e., combining value and growth characteristics). The dependent variable is the average annualized rate of return (in percent) over the past five years. The independent variables are fund expense ratio, portfolio turnover, the natural logarithm of fund size, fund age, and three dummy variables. The multiple manager dummy variable has a value of 1 if the fund has multiple managers (and a value of 0 if it has a single manager). The fund style is indicated by a growth dummy (value of 1 for growth funds and 0 otherwise) and a blend dummy (value of 1 for blend funds and 0 otherwise). If the growth and blend dummies are both zero, the fund is a value fund. The regression output is given in Exhibit 1.

Based on the results shown in Exhibit 1, Honoré wants to test the hypothesis that all of the regression coefficients are equal to zero. For the 555 fund sample, she also wants to compare the performance of growth funds with the value funds.Honoré is concerned about the possible presence of multicollinearity in the regression. She states that adding a new independent variable that is highly correlated with one or more independent variables already in the regression model, has three potential consequences:1. The R2 is expected to decline.2. The regression coefficient estimates can become imprecise and unreliable.3. The standard errors for some or all of the regression coefficients will become inflated.Another concern for the regression model (in Exhibit 1) is conditional heteroskedasticity. Honoré is concerned that the presence of heteroskedasticity can cause both the F-test for the overall significance of the regression and the t-tests for significance of individual regression coefficients to be unreliable. She runs a regression of the squared residuals from the model in Exhibit 1 on the eight independent variables and finds the R2 is 0.0669.As a second research project, Honoré wants to test whether including Morningstar’s rating system, which assigns a one- through five-star rating to a fund, as an independent variable will improve the predictive power of the regression model. To do this, she needs to examine whether values of the independent variables in a given period predict fund return in the next period. Smith suggests three different methods of adding the Morningstar ratings to the model:Method 1: Add an independent variable that has a value equal to the number of stars in the rating of each fund.Method 2: Add five dummy variables, one for each rating.Method 3: Add dummy variables for four of the five ratings.As a third research project, Honoré wants to establish whether bond market returns (proxied by returns of long-term US Treasuries) and stock market returns (proxied by returns of the S&P 500 Index) explain the returns of a portfolio of utility stocks being recommended to clients. Exhibit 2 presents the results of a regression of 10 years of monthly percentage total returns for the utility portfolio on monthly total returns for US Treasuries and the S&P 500.

91,"Iesha Azarov is a senior analyst at Ganymede Moon Partners (Ganymede), where he works with junior analyst Pàola Bector. Azarov would like to incorporate machine learning (ML) models into the company’s analytical process. Azarov asks Bector to develop ML models for two unstructured stock sentiment datasets, Dataset ABC and Dataset XYZ. Both datasets have been cleaned and preprocessed in preparation for text exploration and model training.Following an exploratory data analysis that revealed Dataset ABC’s most frequent tokens, Bector conducts a collection frequency analysis. Bector then computes TF–IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) for several words in the collection and tells Azarov the following:Statement 1: IDF is equal to the inverse of the document frequency measure.Statement 2: TF at the collection level is multiplied by IDF to calculate TF–IDF.Statement 3: TF–IDF values vary by the number of documents in the dataset, and therefore, model performance can vary when applied to a dataset with just a few documents.Bector notes that Dataset ABC is characterized by the absence of ground truth.Bector turns his attention to Dataset XYZ, containing 84,000 tokens and 10,000 sentences. Bector chooses an appropriate feature selection method to identify and remove unnecessary tokens from the dataset and then focuses on model training. For performance evaluation purposes, Dataset XYZ is split into a training set, cross-validation (CV) set, and test set. Each of the sentences has already been labeled as either a positive sentiment (Class “1”) or a negative sentiment (Class “0”) sentence. There is an unequal class distribution between the positive sentiment and negative sentiment sentences in Dataset XYZ. Simple random sampling is applied within levels of the sentiment class labels to balance the class distributions within the splits. Bector’s view is that the false positive and false negative evaluation metrics should be given equal weight. Select performance data from the cross-validation set confusion matrices is presented in Exhibit 1:

92,"Brad Varden, a junior analyst at an actively managed mutual fund, is responsible for research on a subset of the 500 large-cap equities the fund follows. Recently, the fund has been paying close attention to management turnover and to publicly available environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings. Varden is given the task of investigating whether any significant relationship exists between a company's profitability and either of these two characteristics. Colleen Quinni, a senior analyst at the fund, suggests that as an initial step in his investigation, Varden should perform a multiple regression analysis on the variables and report back to her.Varden knows that Quinni is an expert at quantitative research, and she once told Varden that after you get an idea, you should formulate a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, and analyze the results. Varden expects to find that ESG rating is negatively related to ROE and CEO tenure is positively related to ROE. He considers a relationship meaningful when it is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. To begin, Varden collects values for ROE, CEO tenure, and ESG rating for a sample of 40 companies from the large-cap security universe. He performs a multiple regression with ROE (in percent) as the dependent variable and ESG rating and CEO tenure (in years) as the independent variables: Yi = b0 + b1X1i + b2X2i + εi.Exhibit 1 shows the regression results.

DF Associates is one of the companies Varden follows. He wants to predict its ROE using his regression model. DF Associates' corporate ESG rating is 55, and the company's CEO has been in that position for 10.5 years.Varden also wants to check on the relationship between these variables and the dividend growth rate (divgr), so he completes the correlation matrix shown in Exhibit 2.

| Div gr | 0.117 | 0.046 | 0.028 | 1.0 |


Investigating further, Varden determines that dividend growth is not a linear combination of CEO tenure and ESG rating. He is unclear about how additional independent variables would affect the significance of the regression, so he asks Quinni, ""Given this correlation matrix, will both R2 and adjusted R2 automatically increase if I add dividend growth as a third independent variable?""The discussion continues, and Quinni asks two questions.1. What does your F-statistic of 4.161 tell you about the regression?2. In interpreting the overall significance of your regression model, which statistic do you believe is most relevant: R2, adjusted R2, or the F-statistic?Varden answers both questions correctly and says he wants to check two more ideas. He believes the following:1. ROE is less correlated with the dividend growth rate in firms whose CEO has been in office more than 15 years, and2. CEO tenure is a normally distributed random variable.Later, Varden includes the dividend growth rate as a third independent variable and runs the regression on the fund's entire group of 500 large-cap equities. He finds that the adjusted R2 is much higher than the results in Exhibit 1. He reports this to Quinni and says, “Adding the dividend growth rate gives a model with a higher adjusted R2. The three-variable model is clearly better.” Quinni cautions, ""I don't think you can conclude that yet.”
Based on Exhibit 2, Quinni's best answer to Varden's question about the effect of adding a third independent variable is:",no for R<sup>2</sup> and no for adjusted R<sup>2</sup>.,yes for R<sup>2</sup> and no for adjusted R<sup>2</sup>.,yes for R<sup>2</sup> and yes for adjusted R<sup>2</sup>.,,B

99,"Doris Honoré is a securities analyst with a large wealth management firm. She and her colleague Bill Smith are addressing three research topics: how investment fund characteristics affect fund total returns, whether a fund rating system helps predict fund returns, and whether stock and bond market returns explain the returns of a portfolio of utility shares run by the firm.To explore the first topic, Honoré decides to study US mutual funds using a sample of 555 large-cap US equity funds. The sample includes funds in style classes of value, growth, and blend (i.e., combining value and growth characteristics). The dependent variable is the average annualized rate of return (in percent) over the past five years. The independent variables are fund expense ratio, portfolio turnover, the natural logarithm of fund size, fund age, and three dummy variables. The multiple manager dummy variable has a value of 1 if the fund has multiple managers (and a value of 0 if it has a single manager). The fund style is indicated by a growth dummy (value of 1 for growth funds and 0 otherwise) and a blend dummy (value of 1 for blend funds and 0 otherwise). If the growth and blend dummies are both zero, the fund is a value fund. The regression output is given in Exhibit 1.

Based on the results shown in Exhibit 1, Honoré wants to test the hypothesis that all of the regression coefficients are equal to zero. For the 555 fund sample, she also wants to compare the performance of growth funds with the value funds.Honoré is concerned about the possible presence of multicollinearity in the regression. She states that adding a new independent variable that is highly correlated with one or more independent variables already in the regression model, has three potential consequences:1.

100,"Doris Honore is a securities analyst with a large wealth management firm. She and her colleague Bill Smith are addressing three research topics: how investment fund characteristics affect fund total returns, whether a fund rating system helps predict fund returns, and whether stock and bond market returns explain the returns of a portfolio of utility shares run by the firm.To explore the first topic, Honore decides to study US mutual funds using a sample of 555 large-cap US equity funds. The sample includes funds in style classes of value, growth, and blend (i.e., combining value and growth characteristics). The dependent variable is the average annualized rate of return (in percent) over the past five years. The independent variables are fund expense ratio, portfolio turnover, the natural logarithm of fund size, fund age, and three dummy variables. The multiple manager dummy variable has a value of 1 if the fund has multiple managers (and a value of 0 if it has a single manager). The fund style is indicated by a growth dummy (value of 1 for growth funds and 0 otherwise) and a blend dummy (value of 1 for blend funds and 0 otherwise). If the growth and blend dummies are both zero, the fund is a value fund. The regression output is given in Exhibit 1.

Based on the results shown in Exhibit 1, Honore wants to test the hypothesis that all of the regression coefficients are equal to zero. For the 555 fund sample, she also wants to compare the performance of growth funds with the value funds.Honore is concerned about the possible presence of multicollinearity in the regression. She states that adding a new independent variable that is highly correlated with one or more independent variables already in the regression model, has three potential consequences:1. The R2 is expected to decline.2. The regression coefficient estimates can become imprecise and unreliable.3. The standard errors for some or all of the regression coefficients will become inflated.Another concern for the regression model (in Exhibit 1) is conditional heteroskedasticity.

For the time-series model in Exhibit 2, Honore says that positive serial correlation would not require that the estimated coefficients be adjusted, but that the standard errors of the regression coefficients would be underestimated. This issue would cause the t-statistics of the regression coefficients to be inflated. Honore tests the null hypothesis that the there is no serial correlation in the regression residuals and finds that the Durbin-Watson statistic is equal to 1.81. The critical values at the 0.05 significance level for the Durbin-Watson statistic are dl = 1.63 and du = 1.72.Smith asks whether Honore should have estimated the models in Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2 using a probit or logit model instead of using a traditional regression analysis.

She calculates the short interest ratio (the ratio of short interest to average daily share volume, expressed in days) for 50 companies as of the end of 2016 and compares this ratio with the companies' debt ratio (the ratio of total liabilities to total assets, expressed in decimal form).Liu provides a number of statistics in Exhibit 1. She also estimates a simple regression to investigate the effect of the debt ratio on a company's short interest ratio. The results of this simple regression, including the analysis of variance (ANOVA), are shown in Exhibit 2.In addition to estimating a regression equation, Liu graphs the 50 observations using a scatterplot, with the short interest ratio on the vertical axis and the debt ratio on the horizontal axis.

104,"Alef Associates manages a long-only fund specializing in global smallcap equities. Since its founding a decade ago, Alef maintains a portfolio of 100 stocks (out of an eligible universe of about 10,000 stocks). Some of these holdings are the result of screening the universe for attractive stocks based on several ratios that use readily available market and accounting data; others are the result of investment ideas generated by Alef’s professional staff of five securities analysts and two portfolio managers.Although Alef’s investment performance has been good, its Chief Investment Officer, Paul Moresanu, is contemplating a change in the investment process aimed at achieving even better returns. After attending multiple workshops and being approached by data vendors, Moresanu feels that data science should play a role in the way Alef selects its investments. He has also noticed that much of Alef’s past outperformance is due to stocks that became takeover targets. After some research and reflection, Moresanu writes the following email to the Alef’s CEO.Subject: Investment Process ReorganizationI have been thinking about modernizing the way we select stock investments. Given that our past success has put Alef Associates in an excellent financial position, now seems to be a good time to invest in our future. What I propose is that we continue managing a portfolio of 100 global small-cap stocks but restructure our process to benefit from machine learning (ML). Importantly, the new process will still allow a role for human insight, for example, in providing domain knowledge. In addition, I think we should make a special effort to identify companies that are likely to be acquired. Specifically, I suggest following the four steps which would be repeated every quarter.Step 1 We apply ML techniques to a model including fundamental and technical variables (features) to predict next quarter’s return for each of the 100 stocks currently in our portfolio. Then, the 20 stocks with the lowest estimated return are identified for replacement.Step 2 We utilize ML techniques to divide our investable universe of about 10,000 stocks into 20 different groups, based on a wide variety of the most relevant financial and non-financial characteristics. The idea is to prevent unintended portfolio concentration by selecting stocks from each of these distinct groups.Step 3 For each of the 20 different groups, we use labeled data to train a model that will predict the five stocks (in any given group) that are most likely to become acquisition targets in the next one year.Step 4 Our five experienced securities analysts are each assigned four of the groups, and then each analyst selects their one best stock pick from each of their assigned groups. These 20 “high-conviction” stocks will be added to our portfolio (in replacement of the 20 relatively underperforming stocks to be sold in Step 1).A couple of additional comments related to the above:Comment 1 The ML algorithms will require large amounts of data. We would first need to explore using free or inexpensive historical datasets and then evaluate their usefulness for the ML-based stock selection processes before deciding on using data that requires subscription.Comment 2 As time passes, we expect to find additional ways to apply ML techniques to refine Alef’s investment processes.What do you think?Paul Moresanu

108,"Aaliyah Schultz is a fixed-income portfolio manager at Aries Investments. Schultz supervises Ameris Steele, a junior analyst.A few years ago, Schultz developed a proprietary machine learning (ML) model that aims to predict downgrades of publicly-traded firms by bond rating agencies. The model currently relies only on structured financial data collected from different sources. Schultz thinks the model’s predictive power may be improved by incorporat-ing sentiment data derived from textual analysis of news articles and Twitter content relating to the subject companies.Schultz and Steele meet to discuss plans for incorporating the sentiment data into the model. They discuss the differences in the steps between building ML models that use traditional structured data and building ML models that use textual big data. Steele tells Schultz:Statement 1 The second step in building text-based ML models is text prepa-ration and wrangling, whereas the second step in building ML models using structured data is data collection.Statement 2 The fourth step in building both types of models encompasses data/text exploration.Steele expresses concern about using Twitter content in the model, noting that research suggests that as much as 10%–15% of social media content is from fake accounts. Schultz tells Steele that she understands her concern but thinks the potential for model improvement outweighs the concern.Steele begins building a model that combines the structured financial data and the sentiment data. She starts with cleansing and wrangling the raw structured financial data. Exhibit 1 presents a small sample of the raw dataset before cleansing: Each row represents data for a particular firm.
| Exhibit 1Sample of Raw Structured Data Before Cleansing |
| Industry | Interest |
| ID | Ticker | IPO Date | (NAICS) | EBIT | Expense | Total Debt |

| 4 | KLM | 14-Mar-15 | 72 | 5.7 | 1.5 | 0.0 |


After cleansing the data, Steele then preprocesses the dataset. She creates two new variables: an “Age” variable based on the firm’s IPO date and an “Interest Coverage Ratio” variable equal to EBIT divided by interest expense. She also deletes the “IPO Date” variable from the dataset. After applying these transformations, Steele scales the financial data using normalization. She notes that over the full sample dataset, the “Interest Expense” variable ranges from a minimum of 0.2 and a maximum of 12.2, with a mean of 1.1 and a standard deviation of 0.4.Steele and Schultz then discuss how to preprocess the raw text data. Steele tells Schultz that the process can be completed in the following three steps:Step 1 Cleanse the raw text data.Step 2 Split the cleansed data into a collection of words for them to be normalized.Step 3 Normalize the collection of words from Step 2 and create a distinct set of tokens from the normalized words.With respect to Step 1, Steele tells Schultz:“I believe I should remove all html tags, punctuations, numbers, and extra white spaces from the data before normalizing them.”After properly cleansing the raw text data, Steele completes Steps 2 and 3. She then performs exploratory data analysis. To assist in feature selection, she wants to create a visualization that shows the most informative words in the dataset based on their term frequency (TF) values. After creating and analyzing the visualization, Steele is concerned that some tokens are likely to be noise features for ML model training; therefore, she wants to remove them.Steele and Schultz discuss the importance of feature selection and feature engi-neering in ML model training. Steele tells Schultz:“Appropriate feature selection is a key factor in minimizing model over-fitting, whereas feature engineering tends to prevent model underfitting.”Once satisfied with the final set of features, Steele selects and runs a model on the training set that classifies the text as having positive sentiment (Class “1” or negative sentiment (Class “0”). She then evaluates its performance using error analysis. The resulting confusion matrix is presented in Exhibit 2.

109,"Anh Liu is an analyst researching whether a company’s debt burden affects investors’ decision to short the company’s stock. She calculates the short interest ratio (the ratio of short interest to average daily share volume, expressed in days) for 50 companies as of the end of 2016 and compares this ratio with the companies’ debt ratio (the ratio of total liabilities to total assets, expressed in decimal form).Liu provides a number of statistics in Exhibit 1. She also estimates a simple regression to investigate the effect of the debt ratio on a company’s short interest ratio. The results of this simple regression, including the analysis of variance (ANOVA), are shown in Exhibit 2.In addition to estimating a regression equation, Liu graphs the 50 observations using a scatter plot, with the short interest ratio on the vertical axis and the debt ratio on the horizontal axis.

110,"Doris Honore is a securities analyst with a large wealth management firm. She and her colleague Bill Smith are addressing three research topics: how investment fund characteristics affect fund total returns, whether a fund rating system helps predict fund returns, and whether stock and bond market returns explain the returns of a portfolio of utility shares run by the firm.To explore the first topic, Honore decides to study US mutual funds using a sample of 555 large-cap US equity funds. The sample includes funds in style classes of value, growth, and blend (i.e., combining value and growth characteristics). The dependent variable is the average annualized rate of return (in percent) over the past five years. The independent variables are fund expense ratio, portfolio turnover, the natural logarithm of fund size, fund age, and three dummy variables. The multiple manager dummy variable has a value of 1 if the fund has multiple managers (and a value of 0 if it has a single manager). The fund style is indicated by a growth dummy (value of 1 for growth funds and 0 otherwise) and a blend dummy (value of 1 for blend funds and 0 otherwise). If the growth and blend dummies are both zero, the fund is a value fund. The regression output is given in Exhibit 1.

Based on the results shown in Exhibit 1, Honore wants to test the hypothesis that all of the regression coefficients are equal to zero. For the 555 fund sample, she also wants to compare the performance of growth funds with the value funds.Honore is concerned about the possible presence of multicollinearity in the regression. She states that adding a new independent variable that is highly correlated with one or more independent variables already in the regression model, has three potential consequences:1. The R2 is expected to decline.2. The regression coefficient estimates can become imprecise and unreliable.3. The standard errors for some or all of the regression coefficients will become inflated.Another concern for the regression model (in Exhibit 1) is conditional heteroskedasticity. Honore is concerned that the presence of heteroskedasticity can cause both the F-test for the overall significance of the regression and the t-tests for significance of individual regression coefficients to be unreliable. She runs a regression of the squared residuals from the model in Exhibit 1 on the eight independent variables, and finds the R2 is 0.0669.As a second research project, Honore wants to test whether including Morningstar's rating system, which assigns a one- through five-star rating to a fund, as an independent variable will improve the predictive power of the regression model. To do this, she needs to examine whether values of the independent variables in a given period predict fund return in the next period. Smith suggests three different methods of adding the Morningstar ratings to the model:■ Method 1: Add an independent variable that has a value equal to the number of stars in the rating of each fund.■Method 2: Add five dummy variables, one for each rating.■Method 3: Add dummy variables for four of the five ratings.As a third research project, Honore wants to establish whether bond market returns (proxied by returns of long-term US Treasuries) and stock market returns (proxied by returns of the S&P 500 Index) explain the returns of a portfolio of utility stocks being recommended to clients. Exhibit 2 presents the results of a regression of 10 years of monthly percentage total returns for the utility portfolio on monthly total returns for US Treasuries and the S&P 500.

For the time-series model in Exhibit 2, Honore says that positive serial correlation would not require that the estimated coefficients be adjusted, but that the standard errors of the regression coefficients would be underestimated. This issue would cause the t-statistics of the regression coefficients to be inflated. Honore tests the null hypothesis that the there is no serial correlation in the regression residuals and finds that the Durbin-Watson statistic is equal to 1.81. The critical values at the 0.05 significance level for the Durbin-Watson statistic are dl = 1.63 and du = 1.72.Smith asks whether Honore should have estimated the models in Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2 using a probit or logit model instead of using a traditional regression analysis.
Based on Exhibit 1, the difference between the predicted annualized returns of a growth fund and an otherwise similar value fund is closest to:",1.86%.,2.44%.,3.01%.,,B
111,"Adele Chiesa is a money manager for the Bianco Fund. She is interested in recent findings showing that certain business condition variables predict excess US stock market returns (one-month market return minus one-month T-bill return). She is also familiar with evidence showing how US stock market returns differ by the political party affiliation of the US President. Chiesa estimates a multiple regression model to predict monthly excess stock market returns accounting for business conditions and the political party affiliation of the US President:Excess stock market returnt= a0+ a1Default spreadt–1+ a2Term spreadt–1+ a3Pres party dummyt–1+ etDefault spread is equal to the yield on Baa bonds minus the yield on Aaa bonds.

An intern working for Chiesa has a number of questions about the results in Exhibit 1:Question 1: How do you test to determine whether the overall regression model is significant?Question 2: Does the estimated model conform to standard regression assumptions? For instance, is the error term serially correlated, or is there conditional heteroskedasticity?Question 3: How do you interpret the coefficient for the Pres party dummy variable?Question 4: Default spread appears to be quite important. Is there some way to assess the precision of its estimated coefficient? What is the economic interpretation of this variable?After responding to her intern's questions, Chiesa concludes with the following statement: “Predictions from Exhibit 1 are subject to parameter estimate uncertainty, but not regression model uncertainty.”

112,"Angela Martinez, an energy sector analyst at an investment bank, is concerned about the future level of oil prices and how it might affect portfolio values. She is considering whether to recommend a hedge for the bank portfolio's exposure to changes in oil prices. Martinez examines West Texas Intermediate (WTI) monthly crude oil price data, expressed in US dollars per barrel, for the 181-month period from August 2000 through August 2015. The end-of-month WTI oil price was $51.16 in July 2015 and $42.86 in August 2015 (Month 181).After reviewing the time-series data, Martinez determines that the mean and variance of the time series of oil prices are not constant over time. She then runs the following four regressions using the WTI time-series data.Linear trend model: Oil pricet = b0 + b1t + etLog-linear trend model: In Oil pricet = b0 + b1t + etAR(1) model: Oil pricet = b0 + b1Oil pricet-1 + etAR(2) model: Oil pricet = b0 + b1Oil pricet-1 + b2Oil pricet-2 + etExhibit 1 presents selected data from all four regressions, and Exhibit 2 presents selected autocorrelation data from the AR(1) models.

114,"Iesha Azarov is a senior analyst at Ganymede Moon Partners (Ganymede), where he works with junior analyst Pàola Bector. Azarov would like to incorporate machine learning (ML) models into the company’s analytical process. Azarov asks Bector to develop ML models for two unstructured stock sentiment datasets, Dataset ABC and Dataset XYZ. Both datasets have been cleaned and preprocessed in preparation for text exploration and model training.Following an exploratory data analysis that revealed Dataset ABC’s most frequent tokens, Bector conducts a collection frequency analysis. Bector then computes TF–IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) for several words in the collection and tells Azarov the following:Statement 1: IDF is equal to the inverse of the document frequency measure.Statement 2: TF at the collection level is multiplied by IDF to calculate TF–IDF.Statement 3: TF–IDF values vary by the number of documents in the dataset, and therefore, model performance can vary when applied to a dataset with just a few documents.Bector notes that Dataset ABC is characterized by the absence of ground truth.Bector turns his attention to Dataset XYZ, containing 84,000 tokens and 10,000 sentences. Bector chooses an appropriate feature selection method to identify and remove unnecessary tokens from the dataset and then focuses on model training. For performance evaluation purposes, Dataset XYZ is split into a training set, cross-validation (CV) set, and test set. Each of the sentences has already been labeled as either a positive sentiment (Class “1”) or a negative sentiment (Class “0”) sentence. There is an unequal class distribution between the positive sentiment and negative sentiment sentences in Dataset XYZ. Simple random sampling is applied within levels of the sentiment class labels to balance the class distributions within the splits. Bector’s view is that the false positive and false negative evaluation metrics should be given equal weight. Select performance data from the cross-validation set confusion matrices is presented in Exhibit 1:
| Exhibit 1Performance Metrics for Dataset XYZ |

Azarov and Bector evaluate the Dataset XYZ performance metrics for Confusion Matrices A, B, and C in Exhibit 1. Azarov says, “For Ganymede’s purposes, we should be most concerned with the cost of Type I errors.”Azarov requests that Bector apply the ML model to the test dataset for Dataset XYZ, assuming a threshold p-value of 0.65. Exhibit 2 contains a sample of results from the test dataset corpus.

118,"Howard Golub, CFA, is preparing to write a research report on Stellar Energy Corp. common stock. One of the world's largest companies, Stellar is in the business of refining and marketing oil. As part of his analysis, Golub wants to evaluate the sensitivity of the stock's returns to various economic factors. For example, a client recently asked Golub whether the price of Stellar Energy Corporation stock has tended to rise following increases in retail energy prices. Golub believes the association between the two variables to be negative, but he does not know the strength of the association.Golub directs his assistant, Jill Batten, to study the relationships between Stellar monthly common stock returns versus the previous month's percent change in the US Consumer Price Index for Energy (CPIENG), and Stellar monthly common stock returns versus the previous month's percent change in the US Producer Price Index for Crude Energy Materials (PPICEM). Golub wants Batten to run both a correlation and a linear regression analysis. In response, Batten compiles the summary statistics shown in Exhibit 1 for the 248 months between January 1980 and August 2000. All of the data are in decimal form, where 0.01 indicates a 1 percent return. Batten also runs a regression analysis using Stellar monthly returns as the dependent variable and the monthly change in CPIENG as the independent variable. Exhibit 2 displays the results of this regression model.
