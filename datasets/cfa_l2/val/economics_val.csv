0,"Anna Goldsworthy is the chief financial officer of a manufacturing firm headquartered in the United Kingdom. She is responsible for overseeing exposure to price risk in both the commodity and currency markets. Goldsworthy is settling her end-of-quarter transactions and creating reports. Her intern, Scott Underwood, assists her in this process.The firm hedges input costs using forward contracts that are priced in US dollars (USD) and Mexican pesos (MXN). Processed goods are packaged for sale under licensing agreements with firms in foreign markets. Goldsworthy is expecting to receive a customer payment of JPY 225,000,000 (Japanese yen) that she wants to convert to pounds sterling (GBP). Underwood gathers the exchange rates from Dealer A in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Dealer A's Spot Exchange Rates |
| Spot Exchange Rates |
| Currency Pair | Bid | Offer | Midpoint |
| (Price/Base) |
| JPY/GBP | 187.39 | 187.43 | 187.41 |
| MXN/USD | 17.147 | 17.330 | 17.239 |
| GBP/EUR | 0.7342 | 0.7344 | 0.7343 |
| USD/EUR | 1.1572 | 1.1576 | 1.1574 |
| USD/GBP | 15762 | 1.5766 | 1.5764 |


The firm must also buy USD to pay a major supplier. Goldsworthy calls Dealer A with specific details of the transaction and asks to verify the USD/GBP quote. Dealer A calls her back later with a revised USD/GBP bid/offer quote of 1.5760/1.5768.Goldsworthy must purchase MXN 27,000,000 to pay an invoice at the end of the quarter. In addition to the quotes from Dealer A, Underwood contacts Dealer B, who provides a bid/offer price of GBP/MXN 0.0366/0.0372. To check whether the dealer quotes are reflective of an efficient market, Underwood examines whether the prices allow for an arbitrage profit.In three months, the firm will receive EUR 5,000,000 (euros) from. another customer. Six months ago, the firm sold EUR 5,000,000 against the GBP using a nine-month forward contract at an all-in price of GBP/EUR 0.7400. To mark the position to market, Underwood collects the GBP/EUR forward rates in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit2.GBP/EURForwardRates |
| Maturity | Forward Points |
| One month | 4.40/4.55 |
| Three months | 14.0/15.0 |
| Six months | 29.0/30.0 |


Goldsworthy also asks for the current 90-day Libors for the major currencies. Selected three-month Libors (annualized) are shown in Exhibit 3. Goldsworthy studies Exhibit 3 and says, ""We have the spot rate and the 90-day forward rate for GBP /EUR. As long as we have the GBP 90-day Libor, we will be able to calculate the implied EUR 90-day Libor.”
| Exhibit 3.90-Day Libor |
| Currency | Annualized Rate |
| GBP | 0.5800% |
| JPY | 0.0893% |
| USD | 0.3300% |


After reading a draft report, Underwood notes, ""We do not hedge the incoming Japanese yen cash flow. Your report asks for a forecast of the JPY/GBP exchange rate in 90 days. We know the JPY/GBP spot exchange rate.” He asks, ""Does the information we have collected tell us what the JPY/GBP exchange rate will be in 90 days?""Goldsworthy replies, ""The JPY /GBP exchange rate in 90 days would be a valuable piece of information to know. An international parity condition can be used to provide an estimate of the future spot rate.”
Based on Exhibit 2, Underwood should conclude that three-month EUR Libor is:",below three-month GBP Libor.,equal to three-month GBP Libor.,above three-month GBP Libor.,,A
1,"Ed Smith is a new trainee in the foreign exchange (FX) services department of a major global bank. Smith’s focus is to assist senior FX trader Feliz Mehmet, CFA. Mehmet mentions that an Indian corporate client exporting to the United Kingdom wants to estimate the potential hedging cost for a sale closing in one year. Smith is to determine the premium/discount for an annual (360-day) forward contract using the exchange rate data presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Select Currency Data for GBP and IN R |
| Spot(IN R/GBP) | 79.5093 |
| Annual(360-day) Libor(GBP) | 5.43% |
| Annual(360-day) Libor(IN R) | 7.52% |


Mehmet is also looking at two possible trades to determine their profit potential. The first trade involves a possible triangular arbitrage trade using the Swiss, US, and Brazilian currencies, to be executed based on a dealer’s bid/offer rate quote of 0.2355/0.2358 in CHF/BRL and the interbank spot rate quotes presented in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Interbank Market Quotes |
| Currency Pair | Bid/Offer |
| CHF/USD | 0.9799/0.9801 |
| BRL/USD | 4.1699/4.1701 |


Mehmet is also considering a carry trade involving the USD and the euro. He anticipates it will generate a higher return than buying a one-year domestic note at the current market quote due to low US interest rates and his predictions of exchange rates in one year. To help Mehmet assess the carry trade, Smith provides Mehmet with selected current market data and his one-year forecasts in Exhibit 3.
| Exhibit 3.Spot Rates and Interest Rates for Proposed Carry Trade |
| Today's one-year | Currency pair | Spot rate | Projected spot |
| Libor | (Price/Base) | today | rate in one year |
| USD | 0.80% | CAD/USD | 1.3200 | 1.3151 |
| CAD | 1.71% | EUR/CAD | 0.6506 | 0.6567 |


Finally, Mehmet asks Smith to assist with a trade involving a US multinational customer operating in Europe and Japan. The customer is a very cost-conscious industrial company with an AA credit rating and strives to execute its currency trades at the most favorable bid–offer spread. Because its Japanese subsidiary is about to close on a major European acquisition in three business days, the client wants to lock in a trade involving the Japanese yen and the euro as early as possible the next morning, preferably by 8:05 a.m. New York time.At lunch, Smith and other FX trainees discuss how best to analyze currency market volatility from ongoing financial crises. The group agrees that a theoretical explanation of exchange rate movements, such as the framework of the international parity conditions, should be applicable across all trading environments. They note such analysis should enable traders to anticipate future spot exchange rates. But they disagree on which parity condition best predicts exchange rates, voicing several different assessments. Smith concludes the discussion on parity conditions by stating to the trainees,I believe that in the current environment both covered and uncovered interest rate parity conditions are in effect.
Based upon Exhibit 1, the forward premium (discount) for a 360-day INR/GBP forward contract is closest to:",-1.546,1.546,1.576,,C

Klymchuk instructs an associate economist at EC to assist him in forecasting the change in stock market value for each country. Klymchuk reminds the associate:Statement 1:“Over short time horizons, percentage changes in GDP, the ratio of earnings to GDP, and the price-to-earnings ratio are important factors for describing the relationship between economic growth and stock prices. However, I am interested in a long-term stock market forecast.”A client is considering investing in the sovereign debt of Country A and Country B and asks Klymchuk his opinion of each country's credit risk. Klymchuk tells the client:Statement 2:“Over the next 10 years, I forecast higher potential GDP growth for Country A and lower potential GDP growth for Country B. The capital per worker is similar and very high for both countries, but per capita output is greater for Country A.”The client tells Klymchuk that Country A will offer 50-year bonds and that he believes the bonds could be a good long-term investment given the higher potential GDP growth. Klymchuk responds to the client by saying:Statement 3:After the next 10 years, I think the sustainable rate of economic growth for Country A will be affected by a growing share of its population over the age of 65, a declining percentage under age 16, and minimal immigration.”The client is surprised to learn that Country C, a wealthy, oil-rich country with significant reserves, is experiencing sluggish economic growth and asks Klymchuk for an explanation. Klymchuk responds by stating:Statement 4:“While countries with access to natural resources are often wealthier, the relationship between resource abundance and economic growth is not clear. My analysis shows that the presence of a dominant natural resource (oil) in Country C is constraining growth. Interestingly, Country A has few natural resources, but is experiencing a strong rate of increase in per capita GDP growth.”Klymchuk knows that growth in per capita income cannot be sustained by pure capital deepening. He asks the associate economist to determine how important capital deepening is as a source of economic growth for each country. Klymchuk instructs the associate to use the data provided in Exhibit 1.Klymchuk and his associate debate the concept of convergence. The associate economist believes that developing countries, irrespective of their particular characteristics, will eventually equal developed countries in per capita output. Klymchuk responds as follows:Statement 5:“Poor countries will only converge to the income levels of the richest countries if they make appropriate institutional changes.”
Based solely on the predictions in Statement 2, over the next decade Country B's sovereign credit risk will most likely:",increase.,decrease.,not change.,,A

4,"Hans Schmidt, CFA, is a portfolio manager with a boutique investment firm that specializes in sovereign credit analysis. Schmidt's supervisor asks him to develop estimates for GDP growth for three countries. Information on the three countries is provided in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Select Economic Data for Countries A， B， and C |
| Country | Economy | Capital per Worker |
| A | Developed | High |
| B | Developed | High |
| C | Developing | Low |


After gathering additional data on the three countries, Schmidt shares his findings with colleague, Sean O'Leary. After reviewing the data, O'Leary notes the following observations:Observation 1:The stock market of Country A has appreciated considerably over the past several years. Also, the ratio of corporate profits to GDP for Country A has been trending upward over the past several years and is now well above its historical average.Observation 2:The government of Country C is working hard to bridge the gap between its standard of living and that of developed countries. Currently, the rate of potential GDP growth in Country C is high.Schmidt knows that a large part of the analysis of sovereign credit is to develop a thorough understanding of what the potential GDP growth rate is for a particular country and the region in which the country is located. Schmidt is also doing research on Country D for a client of the firm. Selected economic facts on Country D are provided in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Select Economic Facts for Country D |
| > | Slow GDP Growth |

Prior to wrapping up his research, Schmidt schedules a final meeting with O'Leary to see if he can provide any other pertinent information. O'Leary makes the following statements to Schmidt:Statement 1:Many countries that have the same population growth rate, savings rate, and production function will have growth rates that converge over time.Statement 2:Convergence between countries can occur more quickly if economies are open and there is free trade and international borrowing and lending; however, there is no permanent increase in the rate of growth in an economy from a more open trade policy.
The type of convergence described by O'Leary in Statement 1 is best described as:",club convergence.,absolute convergence.,conditional convergence.,,C
5,"Connor Wagener, a student at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, has been asked to prepare a presentation on foreign exchange rates for his International Business course. Wagener has a basic understanding of exchange rates, but would like a practitioner's perspective, and he has arranged an interview with currency trader Hannah McFadden. During the interview, Wagener asks McFadden:“Could you explain what drives exchange rates? I'm curious as to why our New Zealand dollar was affected by the European debt crisis in 2011 and what other factors impact it.”In response, McFadden begins with a general discussion of exchange rates. She notes that international parity conditions illustrate how exchange rates are linked to expected inflation, interest rate differences, and forward exchange rates as well as current and expected future spot rates. McFadden makes the following statement:Statement 1: “Fortunately, the international parity condition most relevant for FX carry trades does not always hold.”McFadden continues her discussion:“FX carry traders go long (i.e. buy) high-yield currencies and fund their position by shorting, that is borrowing in, low-yield currencies. Unfortunately, crashes in currency values can occur which create financial crises as traders unwind their positions. For example, in 2008, the New Zealand dollar was negatively impacted when highly leveraged carry trades were unwound. In addition to investors, consumers and business owners can also affect currency exchange rates through their impact on their country's balance of payments. For example, if New Zealand consumers purchase more goods from China than New Zealand businesses sell to China, New Zealand will run a trade account deficit with China.”McFadden further explains:Statement 2:“A trade surplus will tend to cause the currency of the country in surplus to appreciate while a deficit will cause currency depreciation. Exchange rate changes will result in immediate adjustments in the prices of traded goods as well as in the demand for imports and exports. These changes will immediately correct the trade imbalance.”McFadden next addresses the influence of monetary and fiscal policy on exchange rates:“Countries also exert significant influence on exchange rates through both the initial mix of their fiscal and monetary policies, and also by subsequent adjustments to those policies. Various models have been developed to identify how these policies affect exchange rates. The Mundell-Fleming model addresses how changes in both fiscal and monetary policies affect interest rates and ultimately exchange rates in the short-term.”McFadden describes monetary models by stating:Statement 3:“Monetary models of exchange rate determination focus on the effects of inflation, price level changes, and risk premium adjustments.”McFadden continues her discussion:“So far, we've touched on balance of payments and monetary policy. The portfolio-balance model addresses the impacts of sustained fiscal policy on exchange rates. I must take a client call, but will return shortly. In the meantime, here is some relevant literature on the models I mentioned along with a couple of questions for you to consider:Question 1:Assume an emerging market (EM) country has restrictive monetary and fiscal policies under low capital mobility conditions. Are these policies likely to lead to currency appreciation, currency depreciation, or to have no impact?Question 2:Assume a developed market (DM) country has an expansive fiscal policy under high capital mobility conditions. Why is its currency most likely to depreciate in the long-run under an integrated Mundell-Fleming and portfolio-balance approach?”Upon her return, Wagener and McFadden review the questions. McFadden notes that capital flows can have a significant impact on exchange rates and have contributed to currency crises in both EM and DM countries. She explains that central banks, like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, use FX market intervention as a tool to manage exchange rates. McFadden states:Statement 4:“Some studies have found that EM central banks tend to be more effective in using exchange rate intervention than DM central banks, primarily because of one important factor.”McFadden continues her discussion:Statement 5:“I mentioned that capital inflows could cause a currency crisis, leaving fund managers with significant losses. In the period leading up to a currency crisis, I would predict that an affected country's:Prediction 1: foreign exchange reserves will increase.Prediction 2: broad money growth in nominal and real terms will increase.Prediction 3: real exchange rate will be substantially higher than its mean level during tranquil periods.After the interview, McFadden agrees to meet the following week to discuss more recent events on the New Zealand dollar.
The factor that McFadden is most likely referring to in Statement 4 is:",FX reserve levels.,domestic demand.,the level of capital flows.,,A
6,"Tiu Asset Management (TAM), a hypothetical financial services firm, recently hired Jonna Yun. Yun is a member of TAM’s Global Equity portfolio team and is assigned the task of analyzing the effects of regulation on the financial services sector of a par-ticular country. In her first report to the team, Yun makes the following statements:Statement 1 The country’s regulator, a government agency, concerned about systemic risk, is calling for an accelerated adoption of central-ized derivatives settlement (as opposed to bilateral settlement between two counterparties)—a more stringent rule—ahead of other major countries that are considering a similar move.Statement 2 Regulators use various tools to intervene in the financial services sector.Statement 3 Regulations may bring benefits to the economy, but they may also have unanticipated costs.Statement 4 The country’s regulatory authorities are considering a regula-tion that is similar to Regulation Q in the United States, which imposed a ceiling on interest rates paid by banks for certain bank deposits.
After Regulation Q was imposed, the demand for money market funds most likely:",increased.,decreased.,remained unchanged.,,A

Unfortunately, crashes in currency values can occur which create financial crises as traders unwind their positions. For example, in 2008, the New Zealand dollar was negatively impacted when highly leveraged carry trades were unwound. In addition to investors, consumers and business owners can also affect currency exchange rates through their impact on their country's balance of payments. For example, if New Zealand consumers purchase more goods from China than New Zealand businesses sell to China, New Zealand will run a trade account deficit with China.”McFadden further explains:Statement 2:“A trade surplus will tend to cause the currency of the country in surplus to appreciate while a deficit will cause currency depreciation. Exchange rate changes will result in immediate adjustments in the prices of traded goods as well as in the demand for imports and exports. These changes will immediately correct the trade imbalance.”McFadden next addresses the influence of monetary and fiscal policy on exchange rates:“Countries also exert significant influence on exchange rates through both the initial mix of their fiscal and monetary policies, and also by subsequent adjustments to those policies. Various models have been developed to identify how these policies affect exchange rates. The Mundell-Fleming model addresses how changes in both fiscal and monetary policies affect interest rates and ultimately exchange rates in the short-term.”McFadden describes monetary models by stating:Statement 3:“Monetary models of exchange rate determination focus on the effects of inflation, price level changes, and risk premium adjustments.”McFadden continues her discussion:“So far, we've touched on balance of payments and monetary policy. The portfolio-balance model addresses the impacts of sustained fiscal policy on exchange rates. I must take a client call, but will return shortly. In the meantime, here is some relevant literature on the models I mentioned along with a couple of questions for you to consider:Question 1:Assume an emerging market (EM) country has restrictive monetary and fiscal policies under low capital mobility conditions. Are these policies likely to lead to currency appreciation, currency depreciation, or to have no impact?Question 2:Assume a developed market (DM) country has an expansive fiscal policy under high capital mobility conditions. Why is its currency most likely to depreciate in the long-run under an integrated Mundell-Fleming and portfolio-balance approach?”Upon her return, Wagener and McFadden review the questions. McFadden notes that capital flows can have a significant impact on exchange rates and have contributed to currency crises in both EM and DM countries. She explains that central banks, like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, use FX market intervention as a tool to manage exchange rates. McFadden states:Statement 4:“Some studies have found that EM central banks tend to be more effective in using exchange rate intervention than DM central banks, primarily because of one important factor.”McFadden continues her discussion:Statement 5:“I mentioned that capital inflows could cause a currency crisis, leaving fund managers with significant losses. In the period leading up to a currency crisis, I would predict that an affected country's:Prediction 1: foreign exchange reserves will increase.Prediction 2: broad money growth in nominal and real terms will increase.Prediction 3: real exchange rate will be substantially higher than its mean level during tranquil periods.After the interview, McFadden agrees to meet the following week to discuss more recent events on the New Zealand dollar.
The international parity condition McFadden is referring to in Statement 1 is:",purchasing power parity.,covered interest rate parity.,uncovered interest rate parity.,,C
11,"Connor Wagener, a student at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, has been asked to prepare a presentation on foreign exchange rates for his International Business course. Wagener has a basic understanding of exchange rates, but would like a practitioner's perspective, and he has arranged an interview with currency trader Hannah McFadden. During the interview, Wagener asks McFadden:“Could you explain what drives exchange rates? I'm curious as to why our New Zealand dollar was affected by the European debt crisis in 2011 and what other factors impact it.”In response, McFadden begins with a general discussion of exchange rates. She notes that international parity conditions illustrate how exchange rates are linked to expected inflation, interest rate differences, and forward exchange rates as well as current and expected future spot rates. McFadden makes the following statement:Statement 1: “Fortunately, the international parity condition most relevant for FX carry trades does not always hold.”McFadden continues her discussion:“FX carry traders go long (i.e. buy) high-yield currencies and fund their position by shorting, that is borrowing in, low-yield currencies.

The firm must also buy USD to pay a major supplier. Goldsworthy calls Dealer A with specific details of the transaction and asks to verify the USD/GBP quote. Dealer A calls her back later with a revised USD/GBP bid/offer quote of 1.5760/1.5768.Goldsworthy must purchase MXN 27,000,000 to pay an invoice at the end of the quarter. In addition to the quotes from Dealer A, Underwood contacts Dealer B, who provides a bid/offer price of GBP/MXN 0.0366/0.0372. To check whether the dealer quotes are reflective of an efficient market, Underwood examines whether the prices allow for an arbitrage profit.In three months, the firm will receive EUR 5,000,000 (euros) from. another customer. Six months ago, the firm sold EUR 5,000,000 against the GBP using a nine-month forward contract at an all-in price of GBP/EUR 0.7400.

14,"Cate Stephenson is an analyst in the economics research division of an international securities firm. She is conducting research on the regulatory environment in certain European countries. Stephenson begins with an analysis of Genovia.Genovia has recently introduced a new accounting statute. In Genovia, there is an independent regulator - “Le regulateur.” Le regulateur is not a self-regulating organization (SRO). There is also an SRO – “L'organisation.” L'organisation is not an independent regulator.In her research report, Stephenson makes the following statements:Statement 1:Le regulateur has been given legal authority by the government to enforce the new statute.Statement 2:L'organisation issues administrative regulations related to the new statute using government funding.Statement 3:L'organisation has member companies that accept the authorization of L'organisation to set and enforce rules and standards. Stephenson and her supervisor discuss the intended and unintended effects of implementing the new statute, and Stephenson makes two comments.Comment 1:It is likely that some unintended consequences will be identified in regulatory filings prior to implementation of the new legislation.Comment 2:Indirect costs arise because of unintended consequences and may result in high unanticipated costs.Stephenson reads a report titled ""International Trade;' which has three sections about Genovia's policies and regulations.The first section of the report discusses policies that legislators may implement to accomplish Genovia's objective of promoting free trade on industrial goods.The second section of the report covers corporate domicile. Stephenson learns that regulators in Genovia recently amended regulations to encourage foreign businesses to move their corporate domicile to Genovia.The third section of the report reviews the regulation of commerce. Genovia's goal is to establish an environment that encourages foreign businesses to increase trade with domestic businesses. Stephenson considers two features of Genovia's regulation of commerce.Feature 1:Recent court decisions have upheld financial liability and bankruptcy laws.Feature 2:A legal structure is in place governing contracts and each party's rights.Stephenson then reviews two initiatives by Genovia to improve domestic policies and regulations.The first initiative by Genovia is its passage of conflict of interest regulations. Regulators implement regulatory restrictions and regulatory mandates that apply to employees of securities firms. One of Stephenson's research colleagues writes reports on a company in which he owns shares.The second initiative by Genovia is to reduce pollution and promote renewable electricity generation. Two years ago, the government implemented taxes on fossil fuels and subsidies on hydropower and other renewables. Stephenson reviews the changes in sources of electricity production since the policies were introduced, shown in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Geno via's Domestic Electricity Generation Production |

15,"Ed Smith is a new trainee in the foreign exchange (FX) services department of a major global bank. Smith’s focus is to assist senior FX trader Feliz Mehmet, CFA. Mehmet mentions that an Indian corporate client exporting to the United Kingdom wants to estimate the potential hedging cost for a sale closing in one year. Smith is to determine the premium/discount for an annual (360-day) forward contract using the exchange rate data presented in Exhibit 1.

| Annual(360-day) Libor(GBP) | 5.43% |
| Annual(360-day) Libor(IN R) | 7.52% |


Mehmet is also looking at two possible trades to determine their profit potential. The first trade involves a possible triangular arbitrage trade using the Swiss, US, and Brazilian currencies, to be executed based on a dealer’s bid/offer rate quote of 0.2355/0.2358 in CHF/BRL and the interbank spot rate quotes presented in Exhibit 2.

| Currency Pair | Bid/Offer |
| CHF/USD | 0.9799/0.9801 |
| BRL/USD | 4.1699/4.1701 |


Mehmet is also considering a carry trade involving the USD and the euro. He anticipates it will generate a higher return than buying a one-year domestic note at the current market quote due to low US interest rates and his predictions of exchange rates in one year. To help Mehmet assess the carry trade, Smith provides Mehmet with selected current market data and his one-year forecasts in Exhibit 3.

| CAD | 1.71% | EUR/CAD | 0.6506 | 0.6567 |


Finally, Mehmet asks Smith to assist with a trade involving a US multinational customer operating in Europe and Japan. The customer is a very cost-conscious industrial company with an AA credit rating and strives to execute its currency trades at the most favorable bid–offer spread. Because its Japanese subsidiary is about to close on a major European acquisition in three business days, the client wants to lock in a trade involving the Japanese yen and the euro as early as possible the next morning, preferably by 8:05 a.m. New York time.At lunch, Smith and other FX trainees discuss how best to analyze currency market volatility from ongoing financial crises. The group agrees that a theoretical explanation of exchange rate movements, such as the framework of the international parity conditions, should be applicable across all trading environments. They note such analysis should enable traders to anticipate future spot exchange rates. But they disagree on which parity condition best predicts exchange rates, voicing several different assessments. Smith concludes the discussion on parity conditions by stating to the trainees,I believe that in the current environment both covered and uncovered interest rate parity conditions are in effect.
If Smith's statement on parity conditions is correct, future spot exchange rates are most likely to be forecast by:",current spot rates.,forward exchange rates.,inflation rate differentials.,,B

19,"Ed Smith is a new trainee in the foreign exchange (FX) services department of a major global bank. Smith’s focus is to assist senior FX trader Feliz Mehmet, CFA. Mehmet mentions that an Indian corporate client exporting to the United Kingdom wants to estimate the potential hedging cost for a sale closing in one year. Smith is to determine the premium/discount for an annual (360-day) forward contract using the exchange rate data presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Select Currency Data for GBP and IN R |
| Spot(IN R/GBP) | 79.5093 |
| Annual(360-day) Libor(GBP) | 5.43% |
| Annual(360-day) Libor(IN R) | 7.52% |


Mehmet is also looking at two possible trades to determine their profit potential. The first trade involves a possible triangular arbitrage trade using the Swiss, US, and Brazilian currencies, to be executed based on a dealer’s bid/offer rate quote of 0.2355/0.2358 in CHF/BRL and the interbank spot rate quotes presented in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Interbank Market Quotes |
| Currency Pair | Bid/Offer |
| CHF/USD | 0.9799/0.9801 |
| BRL/USD | 4.1699/4.1701 |


Mehmet is also considering a carry trade involving the USD and the euro. He anticipates it will generate a higher return than buying a one-year domestic note at the current market quote due to low US interest rates and his predictions of exchange rates in one year. To help Mehmet assess the carry trade, Smith provides Mehmet with selected current market data and his one-year forecasts in Exhibit 3.
| Exhibit 3.Spot Rates and Interest Rates for Proposed Carry Trade |
| Today's one-year | Currency pair | Spot rate | Projected spot |
| Libor | (Price/Base) | today | rate in one year |
| USD | 0.80% | CAD/USD | 1.3200 | 1.3151 |
| CAD | 1.71% | EUR/CAD | 0.6506 | 0.6567 |


Finally, Mehmet asks Smith to assist with a trade involving a US multinational customer operating in Europe and Japan. The customer is a very cost-conscious industrial company with an AA credit rating and strives to execute its currency trades at the most favorable bid–offer spread. Because its Japanese subsidiary is about to close on a major European acquisition in three business days, the client wants to lock in a trade involving the Japanese yen and the euro as early as possible the next morning, preferably by 8:05 a.m. New York time.At lunch, Smith and other FX trainees discuss how best to analyze currency market volatility from ongoing financial crises. The group agrees that a theoretical explanation of exchange rate movements, such as the framework of the international parity conditions, should be applicable across all trading environments. They note such analysis should enable traders to anticipate future spot exchange rates. But they disagree on which parity condition best predicts exchange rates, voicing several different assessments. Smith concludes the discussion on parity conditions by stating to the trainees,I believe that in the current environment both covered and uncovered interest rate parity conditions are in effect.
Based on Exhibit 3, the potential all-in USD return on the carry trade is closest to:",0.83%.,1.23%.,1.63%.,,A
20,"Hans Schmidt, CFA, is a portfolio manager with a boutique investment firm that specializes in sovereign credit analysis. Schmidt's supervisor asks him to develop estimates for GDP growth for three countries. Information on the three countries is provided in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Select Economic Data for Countries A， B， and C |
| Country | Economy | Capital per Worker |
| A | Developed | High |
| B | Developed | High |
| C | Developing | Low |


After gathering additional data on the three countries, Schmidt shares his findings with colleague, Sean O'Leary. After reviewing the data, O'Leary notes the following observations:Observation 1:The stock market of Country A has appreciated considerably over the past several years. Also, the ratio of corporate profits to GDP for Country A has been trending upward over the past several years and is now well above its historical average.Observation 2:The government of Country C is working hard to bridge the gap between its standard of living and that of developed countries. Currently, the rate of potential GDP growth in Country C is high.Schmidt knows that a large part of the analysis of sovereign credit is to develop a thorough understanding of what the potential GDP growth rate is for a particular country and the region in which the country is located. Schmidt is also doing research on Country D for a client of the firm. Selected economic facts on Country D are provided in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Select Economic Facts for Country D |
| > | Slow GDP Growth |
| > | Abundant Natural Resources |
| > | Developed Economic Institutions |


Prior to wrapping up his research, Schmidt schedules a final meeting with O'Leary to see if he can provide any other pertinent information. O'Leary makes the following statements to Schmidt:Statement 1:Many countries that have the same population growth rate, savings rate, and production function will have growth rates that converge over time.Statement 2:Convergence between countries can occur more quickly if economies are open and there is free trade and international borrowing and lending; however, there is no permanent increase in the rate of growth in an economy from a more open trade policy.
Based upon Exhibit 1, the factor that would most likely have the greatest positive impact on the per capita GDP growth of Country A is:",free trade.,technology.,saving and investment.,,B
21,"Connor Wagener, a student at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, has been asked to prepare a presentation on foreign exchange rates for his International Business course. Wagener has a basic understanding of exchange rates, but would like a practitioner's perspective, and he has arranged an interview with currency trader Hannah McFadden. During the interview, Wagener asks McFadden:“Could you explain what drives exchange rates? I'm curious as to why our New Zealand dollar was affected by the European debt crisis in 2011 and what other factors impact it.”In response, McFadden begins with a general discussion of exchange rates. She notes that international parity conditions illustrate how exchange rates are linked to expected inflation, interest rate differences, and forward exchange rates as well as current and expected future spot rates. McFadden makes the following statement:Statement 1: “Fortunately, the international parity condition most relevant for FX carry trades does not always hold.”McFadden continues her discussion:“FX carry traders go long (i.e. buy) high-yield currencies and fund their position by shorting, that is borrowing in, low-yield currencies. Unfortunately, crashes in currency values can occur which create financial crises as traders unwind their positions. For example, in 2008, the New Zealand dollar was negatively impacted when highly leveraged carry trades were unwound. In addition to investors, consumers and business owners can also affect currency exchange rates through their impact on their country's balance of payments. For example, if New Zealand consumers purchase more goods from China than New Zealand businesses sell to China, New Zealand will run a trade account deficit with China.”McFadden further explains:Statement 2:“A trade surplus will tend to cause the currency of the country in surplus to appreciate while a deficit will cause currency depreciation. Exchange rate changes will result in immediate adjustments in the prices of traded goods as well as in the demand for imports and exports. These changes will immediately correct the trade imbalance.”McFadden next addresses the influence of monetary and fiscal policy on exchange rates:“Countries also exert significant influence on exchange rates through both the initial mix of their fiscal and monetary policies, and also by subsequent adjustments to those policies. Various models have been developed to identify how these policies affect exchange rates. The Mundell-Fleming model addresses how changes in both fiscal and monetary policies affect interest rates and ultimately exchange rates in the short-term.”McFadden describes monetary models by stating:Statement 3:“Monetary models of exchange rate determination focus on the effects of inflation, price level changes, and risk premium adjustments.”McFadden continues her discussion:“So far, we've touched on balance of payments and monetary policy. The portfolio-balance model addresses the impacts of sustained fiscal policy on exchange rates. I must take a client call, but will return shortly. In the meantime, here is some relevant literature on the models I mentioned along with a couple of questions for you to consider:Question 1:Assume an emerging market (EM) country has restrictive monetary and fiscal policies under low capital mobility conditions. Are these policies likely to lead to currency appreciation, currency depreciation, or to have no impact?Question 2:Assume a developed market (DM) country has an expansive fiscal policy under high capital mobility conditions. Why is its currency most likely to depreciate in the long-run under an integrated Mundell-Fleming and portfolio-balance approach?”Upon her return, Wagener and McFadden review the questions. McFadden notes that capital flows can have a significant impact on exchange rates and have contributed to currency crises in both EM and DM countries. She explains that central banks, like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, use FX market intervention as a tool to manage exchange rates. McFadden states:Statement 4:“Some studies have found that EM central banks tend to be more effective in using exchange rate intervention than DM central banks, primarily because of one important factor.”McFadden continues her discussion:Statement 5:“I mentioned that capital inflows could cause a currency crisis, leaving fund managers with significant losses. In the period leading up to a currency crisis, I would predict that an affected country's:Prediction 1: foreign exchange reserves will increase.Prediction 2: broad money growth in nominal and real terms will increase.Prediction 3: real exchange rate will be substantially higher than its mean level during tranquil periods.After the interview, McFadden agrees to meet the following week to discuss more recent events on the New Zealand dollar.
In Statement 2, McFadden is most likely failing to consider the:",initial gap between the country's imports and exports.,price elasticity of export demand versus import demand.,lag in the response of import and export demand to price changes.,,C
22,"Cate Stephenson is an analyst in the economics research division of an international securities firm. She is conducting research on the regulatory environment in certain European countries. Stephenson begins with an analysis of Genovia.Genovia has recently introduced a new accounting statute. In Genovia, there is an independent regulator - “Le regulateur.” Le regulateur is not a self-regulating organization (SRO). There is also an SRO – “L'organisation.” L'organisation is not an independent regulator.In her research report, Stephenson makes the following statements:Statement 1:Le regulateur has been given legal authority by the government to enforce the new statute.Statement 2:L'organisation issues administrative regulations related to the new statute using government funding.Statement 3:L'organisation has member companies that accept the authorization of L'organisation to set and enforce rules and standards. Stephenson and her supervisor discuss the intended and unintended effects of implementing the new statute, and Stephenson makes two comments.Comment 1:It is likely that some unintended consequences will be identified in regulatory filings prior to implementation of the new legislation.Comment 2:Indirect costs arise because of unintended consequences and may result in high unanticipated costs.Stephenson reads a report titled ""International Trade;' which has three sections about Genovia's policies and regulations.The first section of the report discusses policies that legislators may implement to accomplish Genovia's objective of promoting free trade on industrial goods.The second section of the report covers corporate domicile. Stephenson learns that regulators in Genovia recently amended regulations to encourage foreign businesses to move their corporate domicile to Genovia.The third section of the report reviews the regulation of commerce. Genovia's goal is to establish an environment that encourages foreign businesses to increase trade with domestic businesses. Stephenson considers two features of Genovia's regulation of commerce.Feature 1:Recent court decisions have upheld financial liability and bankruptcy laws.Feature 2:A legal structure is in place governing contracts and each party's rights.Stephenson then reviews two initiatives by Genovia to improve domestic policies and regulations.The first initiative by Genovia is its passage of conflict of interest regulations. Regulators implement regulatory restrictions and regulatory mandates that apply to employees of securities firms. One of Stephenson's research colleagues writes reports on a company in which he owns shares.The second initiative by Genovia is to reduce pollution and promote renewable electricity generation. Two years ago, the government implemented taxes on fossil fuels and subsidies on hydropower and other renewables. Stephenson reviews the changes in sources of electricity production since the policies were introduced, shown in Exhibit 1.

23,"Anna Goldsworthy is the chief financial officer of a manufacturing firm headquartered in the United Kingdom. She is responsible for overseeing exposure to price risk in both the commodity and currency markets. Goldsworthy is settling her end-of-quarter transactions and creating reports. Her intern, Scott Underwood, assists her in this process.The firm hedges input costs using forward contracts that are priced in US dollars (USD) and Mexican pesos (MXN). Processed goods are packaged for sale under licensing agreements with firms in foreign markets. Goldsworthy is expecting to receive a customer payment of JPY 225,000,000 (Japanese yen) that she wants to convert to pounds sterling (GBP). Underwood gathers the exchange rates from Dealer A in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Dealer A's Spot Exchange Rates |
| Spot Exchange Rates |
| Currency Pair | Bid | Offer | Midpoint |
| (Price/Base) |
| JPY/GBP | 187.39 | 187.43 | 187.41 |
| MXN/USD | 17.147 | 17.330 | 17.239 |
| GBP/EUR | 0.7342 | 0.7344 | 0.7343 |
| USD/EUR | 1.1572 | 1.1576 | 1.1574 |
| USD/GBP | 15762 | 1.5766 | 1.5764 |


The firm must also buy USD to pay a major supplier. Goldsworthy calls Dealer A with specific details of the transaction and asks to verify the USD/GBP quote. Dealer A calls her back later with a revised USD/GBP bid/offer quote of 1.5760/1.5768.Goldsworthy must purchase MXN 27,000,000 to pay an invoice at the end of the quarter. In addition to the quotes from Dealer A, Underwood contacts Dealer B, who provides a bid/offer price of GBP/MXN 0.0366/0.0372. To check whether the dealer quotes are reflective of an efficient market, Underwood examines whether the prices allow for an arbitrage profit.In three months, the firm will receive EUR 5,000,000 (euros) from. another customer. Six months ago, the firm sold EUR 5,000,000 against the GBP using a nine-month forward contract at an all-in price of GBP/EUR 0.7400. To mark the position to market, Underwood collects the GBP/EUR forward rates in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit2.GBP/EURForwardRates |
| Maturity | Forward Points |
| One month | 4.40/4.55 |
| Three months | 14.0/15.0 |
| Six months | 29.0/30.0 |


Goldsworthy also asks for the current 90-day Libors for the major currencies. Selected three-month Libors (annualized) are shown in Exhibit 3. Goldsworthy studies Exhibit 3 and says, ""We have the spot rate and the 90-day forward rate for GBP /EUR. As long as we have the GBP 90-day Libor, we will be able to calculate the implied EUR 90-day Libor.”
| Exhibit 3.90-Day Libor |
| Currency | Annualized Rate |
| GBP | 0.5800% |
| JPY | 0.0893% |
| USD | 0.3300% |


After reading a draft report, Underwood notes, ""We do not hedge the incoming Japanese yen cash flow. Your report asks for a forecast of the JPY/GBP exchange rate in 90 days. We know the JPY/GBP spot exchange rate.” He asks, ""Does the information we have collected tell us what the JPY/GBP exchange rate will be in 90 days?""Goldsworthy replies, ""The JPY /GBP exchange rate in 90 days would be a valuable piece of information to know. An international parity condition can be used to provide an estimate of the future spot rate.”
Using Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, which international parity condition would Goldsworthy most likely use to calculate the EUR Libor?",Real interest rate parity,Covered interest rate parity,Uncovered interest rate parity,,B

Klymchuk instructs an associate economist at EC to assist him in forecasting the change in stock market value for each country. Klymchuk reminds the associate:Statement 1:“Over short time horizons, percentage changes in GDP, the ratio of earnings to GDP, and the price-to-earnings ratio are important factors for describing the relationship between economic growth and stock prices. However, I am interested in a long-term stock market forecast.”A client is considering investing in the sovereign debt of Country A and Country B and asks Klymchuk his opinion of each country's credit risk. Klymchuk tells the client:Statement 2:“Over the next 10 years, I forecast higher potential GDP growth for Country A and lower potential GDP growth for Country B. The capital per worker is similar and very high for both countries, but per capita output is greater for Country A.”The client tells Klymchuk that Country A will offer 50-year bonds and that he believes the bonds could be a good long-term investment given the higher potential GDP growth. Klymchuk responds to the client by saying:Statement 3:After the next 10 years, I think the sustainable rate of economic growth for Country A will be affected by a growing share of its population over the age of 65, a declining percentage under age 16, and minimal immigration.”The client is surprised to learn that Country C, a wealthy, oil-rich country with significant reserves, is experiencing sluggish economic growth and asks Klymchuk for an explanation. Klymchuk responds by stating:Statement 4:“While countries with access to natural resources are often wealthier, the relationship between resource abundance and economic growth is not clear. My analysis shows that the presence of a dominant natural resource (oil) in Country C is constraining growth. Interestingly, Country A has few natural resources, but is experiencing a strong rate of increase in per capita GDP growth.”Klymchuk knows that growth in per capita income cannot be sustained by pure capital deepening. He asks the associate economist to determine how important capital deepening is as a source of economic growth for each country. Klymchuk instructs the associate to use the data provided in Exhibit 1.Klymchuk and his associate debate the concept of convergence. The associate economist believes that developing countries, irrespective of their particular characteristics, will eventually equal developed countries in per capita output. Klymchuk responds as follows:Statement 5:“Poor countries will only converge to the income levels of the richest countries if they make appropriate institutional changes.”
Based upon Statement 1, over the requested forecast horizon, the factor that will most likely drive stock market performance is the percentage change in:",GDP.,the earnings to GDP ratio.,the price-to-earnings ratio.,,A

29,"Cate Stephenson is an analyst in the economics research division of an international securities firm. She is conducting research on the regulatory environment in certain European countries. Stephenson begins with an analysis of Genovia.Genovia has recently introduced a new accounting statute. In Genovia, there is an independent regulator - “Le regulateur.” Le regulateur is not a self-regulating organization (SRO). There is also an SRO – “L'organisation.” L'organisation is not an independent regulator.In her research report, Stephenson makes the following statements:Statement 1:Le regulateur has been given legal authority by the government to enforce the new statute.Statement 2:L'organisation issues administrative regulations related to the new statute using government funding.Statement 3:L'organisation has member companies that accept the authorization of L'organisation to set and enforce rules and standards. Stephenson and her supervisor discuss the intended and unintended effects of implementing the new statute, and Stephenson makes two comments.Comment 1:It is likely that some unintended consequences will be identified in regulatory filings prior to implementation of the new legislation.Comment 2:Indirect costs arise because of unintended consequences and may result in high unanticipated costs.Stephenson reads a report titled ""International Trade;' which has three sections about Genovia's policies and regulations.The first section of the report discusses policies that legislators may implement to accomplish Genovia's objective of promoting free trade on industrial goods.The second section of the report covers corporate domicile. Stephenson learns that regulators in Genovia recently amended regulations to encourage foreign businesses to move their corporate domicile to Genovia.The third section of the report reviews the regulation of commerce. Genovia's goal is to establish an environment that encourages foreign businesses to increase trade with domestic businesses. Stephenson considers two features of Genovia's regulation of commerce.Feature 1:Recent court decisions have upheld financial liability and bankruptcy laws.Feature 2:A legal structure is in place governing contracts and each party's rights.Stephenson then reviews two initiatives by Genovia to improve domestic policies and regulations.The first initiative by Genovia is its passage of conflict of interest regulations. Regulators implement regulatory restrictions and regulatory mandates that apply to employees of securities firms. One of Stephenson's research colleagues writes reports on a company in which he owns shares.The second initiative by Genovia is to reduce pollution and promote renewable electricity generation. Two years ago, the government implemented taxes on fossil fuels and subsidies on hydropower and other renewables. Stephenson reviews the changes in sources of electricity production since the policies were introduced, shown in Exhibit 1.

Wagener has a basic understanding of exchange rates, but would like a practitioner's perspective, and he has arranged an interview with currency trader Hannah McFadden. During the interview, Wagener asks McFadden:“Could you explain what drives exchange rates? I'm curious as to why our New Zealand dollar was affected by the European debt crisis in 2011 and what other factors impact it.”In response, McFadden begins with a general discussion of exchange rates. She notes that international parity conditions illustrate how exchange rates are linked to expected inflation, interest rate differences, and forward exchange rates as well as current and expected future spot rates. McFadden states:Statement 1: “Fortunately, the international parity condition most relevant for FX carry trades does not always hold.”McFadden continues her discussion:“FX carry traders go long (i.e. buy) high-yield currencies and fund their position by shorting, that is borrowing in, low-yield currencies. Unfortunately, crashes in currency values can occur which create financial crises as traders unwind their positions. For example, in 2008, the New Zealand dollar was negatively impacted when highly leveraged carry trades were unwound. In addition to investors, consumers and business owners can also affect currency exchange rates through their impact on their country's balance of payments. For example, if New Zealand consumers purchase more goods from China than New Zealand businesses sell to China, New Zealand will run a trade account deficit with China.”McFadden further explains:Statement 2:“A trade surplus will tend to cause the currency of the country in surplus to appreciate while a deficit will cause currency depreciation. Exchange rate changes will result in immediate adjustments in the prices of traded goods as well as in the demand for imports and exports. These changes will immediately correct the trade imbalance.”McFadden next addresses the influence of monetary and fiscal policy on exchange rates:“Countries also exert significant influence on exchange rates through both the initial mix of their fiscal and monetary policies, and also by subsequent adjustments to those policies. Various models have been developed to identify how these policies affect exchange rates. The Mundell-Fleming model addresses how changes in both fiscal and monetary policies affect interest rates and ultimately exchange rates in the short-term.”McFadden describes monetary models by stating:Statement 3:“Monetary models of exchange rate determination focus on the effects of inflation, price level changes, and risk premium adjustments.”McFadden continues her discussion:“So far, we've touched on balance of payments and monetary policy. The portfolio-balance model addresses the impacts of sustained fiscal policy on exchange rates. I must take a client call, but will return shortly. In the meantime, here is some relevant literature on the models I mentioned along with a couple of questions for you to consider:Question 1: Assume an emerging market (EM) country has restrictive monetary and fiscal policies under low capital mobility conditions. Are these policies likely to lead to currency appreciation, currency depreciation, or to have no impact?Question 2: Assume a developed market (DM) country has an expansive fiscal policy under high capital mobility conditions. Why is its currency most likely to depreciate in the long-run under an integrated Mundell-Fleming and portfolio-balance approach?”Upon her return, Wagener and McFadden review the questions. McFadden notes that capital flows can have a significant impact on exchange rates and have contributed to currency crises in both EM and DM countries. She explains that central banks, like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, use FX market intervention as a tool to manage exchange rates. McFadden states:Statement 4:“Some studies have found that EM central banks tend to be more effective in using exchange rate intervention than DM central banks, primarily because of one important factor.”McFadden continues her discussion:Statement 5:“I mentioned that capital inflows could cause a currency crisis, leaving fund managers with significant losses.

32,"Ed Smith is a new trainee in the foreign exchange (FX) services department of a major global bank. Smith’s focus is to assist senior FX trader Feliz Mehmet, CFA. Mehmet mentions that an Indian corporate client exporting to the United Kingdom wants to estimate the potential hedging cost for a sale closing in one year. Smith is to determine the premium/discount for an annual (360-day) forward contract using the exchange rate data presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Select Currency Data for GBP and IN R |
| Spot(IN R/GBP) | 79.5093 |
| Annual(360-day) Libor(GBP) | 5.43% |
| Annual(360-day) Libor(IN R) | 7.52% |


Mehmet is also looking at two possible trades to determine their profit potential. The first trade involves a possible triangular arbitrage trade using the Swiss, US, and Brazilian currencies, to be executed based on a dealer’s bid/offer rate quote of 0.2355/0.2358 in CHF/BRL and the interbank spot rate quotes presented in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Interbank Market Quotes |
| Currency Pair | Bid/Offer |
| CHF/USD | 0.9799/0.9801 |
| BRL/USD | 4.1699/4.1701 |


Mehmet is also considering a carry trade involving the USD and the euro. He anticipates it will generate a higher return than buying a one-year domestic note at the current market quote due to low US interest rates and his predictions of exchange rates in one year. To help Mehmet assess the carry trade, Smith provides Mehmet with selected current market data and his one-year forecasts in Exhibit 3.
| Exhibit 3.Spot Rates and Interest Rates for Proposed Carry Trade |
| Today's one-year | Currency pair | Spot rate | Projected spot |
| Libor | (Price/Base) | today | rate in one year |
| USD | 0.80% | CAD/USD | 1.3200 | 1.3151 |
| CAD | 1.71% | EUR/CAD | 0.6506 | 0.6567 |


Finally, Mehmet asks Smith to assist with a trade involving a US multinational customer operating in Europe and Japan. The customer is a very cost-conscious industrial company with an AA credit rating and strives to execute its currency trades at the most favorable bid–offer spread. Because its Japanese subsidiary is about to close on a major European acquisition in three business days, the client wants to lock in a trade involving the Japanese yen and the euro as early as possible the next morning, preferably by 8:05 a.m. New York time.At lunch, Smith and other FX trainees discuss how best to analyze currency market volatility from ongoing financial crises. The group agrees that a theoretical explanation of exchange rate movements, such as the framework of the international parity conditions, should be applicable across all trading environments. They note such analysis should enable traders to anticipate future spot exchange rates. But they disagree on which parity condition best predicts exchange rates, voicing several different assessments. Smith concludes the discussion on parity conditions by stating to the trainees,I believe that in the current environment both covered and uncovered interest rate parity conditions are in effect.
Based on Exhibit 2, the most appropriate recommendation regarding the triangular arbitrage trade is to:","decline the trade, no arbitrage profits are possible.","execute the trade, buy BRL in the interbank market and sell it to the dealer.","execute the trade, buy BRL from the dealer and sell it in the interbank market.",,B

| Exhibit l.Select Economic Data for Countries A， B， and C |
| Country | Economy | Capital per Worker |
| A | Developed | High |
| B | Developed | High |
| C | Developing | Low |


After gathering additional data on the three countries, Schmidt shares his findings with colleague, Sean O'Leary. After reviewing the data, O'Leary notes the following observations:Observation 1:The stock market of Country A has appreciated considerably over the past several years. Also, the ratio of corporate profits to GDP for Country A has been trending upward over the past several years and is now well above its historical average.Observation 2:The government of Country C is working hard to bridge the gap between its standard of living and that of developed countries. Currently, the rate of potential GDP growth in Country C is high.Schmidt knows that a large part of the analysis of sovereign credit is to develop a thorough understanding of what the potential GDP growth rate is for a particular country and the region in which the country is located. Schmidt is also doing research on Country D for a client of the firm. Selected economic facts on Country D are provided in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Select Economic Facts for Country D |
| > | Slow GDP Growth |
| > | Abundant Natural Resources |
| > | Developed Economic Institutions |


Prior to wrapping up his research, Schmidt schedules a final meeting with O'Leary to see if he can provide any other pertinent information. O'Leary makes the following statements to Schmidt:Statement 1:Many countries that have the same population growth rate, savings rate, and production function will have growth rates that converge over time.Statement 2:Convergence between countries can occur more quickly if economies are open and there is free trade and international borrowing and lending; however, there is no permanent increase in the rate of growth in an economy from a more open trade policy.

39,"Hans Schmidt, CFA, is a portfolio manager with a boutique investment firm that specializes in sovereign credit analysis. Schmidt's supervisor asks him to develop estimates for GDP growth for three countries. Information on the three countries is provided in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Select Economic Data for Countries A， B， and C |
| Country | Economy | Capital per Worker |
| A | Developed | High |
| B | Developed | High |
| C | Developing | Low |


After gathering additional data on the three countries, Schmidt shares his findings with colleague, Sean O'Leary. After reviewing the data, O'Leary notes the following observations:Observation 1:The stock market of Country A has appreciated considerably over the past several years. Also, the ratio of corporate profits to GDP for Country A has been trending upward over the past several years and is now well above its historical average.Observation 2:The government of Country C is working hard to bridge the gap between its standard of living and that of developed countries. Currently, the rate of potential GDP growth in Country C is high.Schmidt knows that a large part of the analysis of sovereign credit is to develop a thorough understanding of what the potential GDP growth rate is for a particular country and the region in which the country is located. Schmidt is also doing research on Country D for a client of the firm. Selected economic facts on Country D are provided in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2.Select Economic Facts for Country D |
| > | Slow GDP Growth |
| > | Abundant Natural Resources |
| > | Developed Economic Institutions |


Prior to wrapping up his research, Schmidt schedules a final meeting with O'Leary to see if he can provide any other pertinent information. O'Leary makes the following statements to Schmidt:Statement 1:Many countries that have the same population growth rate, savings rate, and production function will have growth rates that converge over time.Statement 2:Convergence between countries can occur more quickly if economies are open and there is free trade and international borrowing and lending; however, there is no permanent increase in the rate of growth in an economy from a more open trade policy.
Based upon Observation 2, Country C is most likely to have:",relatively low real asset returns.,a relatively low real interest rate.,a relatively high real interest rate.,,C

Klymchuk instructs an associate economist at EC to assist him in forecasting the change in stock market value for each country. Klymchuk reminds the associate:Statement 1:“Over short time horizons, percentage changes in GDP, the ratio of earnings to GDP, and the price-to-earnings ratio are important factors for describing the relationship between economic growth and stock prices. However, I am interested in a long-term stock market forecast.”A client is considering investing in the sovereign debt of Country A and Country B and asks Klymchuk his opinion of each country's credit risk. Klymchuk tells the client:Statement 2:“Over the next 10 years, I forecast higher potential GDP growth for Country A and lower potential GDP growth for Country B. The capital per worker is similar and very high for both countries, but per capita output is greater for Country A.”The client tells Klymchuk that Country A will offer 50-year bonds and that he believes the bonds could be a good long-term investment given the higher potential GDP growth. Klymchuk responds to the client by saying:Statement 3:After the next 10 years, I think the sustainable rate of economic growth for Country A will be affected by a growing share of its population over the age of 65, a declining percentage under age 16, and minimal immigration.”The client is surprised to learn that Country C, a wealthy, oil-rich country with significant reserves, is experiencing sluggish economic growth and asks Klymchuk for an explanation. Klymchuk responds by stating:Statement 4:“While countries with access to natural resources are often wealthier, the relationship between resource abundance and economic growth is not clear. My analysis shows that the presence of a dominant natural resource (oil) in Country C is constraining growth. Interestingly, Country A has few natural resources, but is experiencing a strong rate of increase in per capita GDP growth.”Klymchuk knows that growth in per capita income cannot be sustained by pure capital deepening. He asks the associate economist to determine how important capital deepening is as a source of economic growth for each country. Klymchuk instructs the associate to use the data provided in Exhibit 1.Klymchuk and his associate debate the concept of convergence. The associate economist believes that developing countries, irrespective of their particular characteristics, will eventually equal developed countries in per capita output. Klymchuk responds as follows:Statement 5:“Poor countries will only converge to the income levels of the richest countries if they make appropriate institutional changes.”
Based upon Statement 4, the higher rate of per capita income growth in Country A is least likely explained by the:",rate of investment.,growth of its population.,application of information technology.,,B

She is responsible for overseeing exposure to price risk in both the commodity and currency markets. Goldsworthy is settling her end-of-quarter transactions and creating reports. Her intern, Scott Underwood, assists her in this process.The firm hedges input costs using forward contracts that are priced in US dollars (USD) and Mexican pesos (MXN). Processed goods are packaged for sale under licensing agreements with firms in foreign markets. Goldsworthy is expecting to receive a customer payment of JPY 225,000,000 (Japanese yen) that she wants to convert to pounds sterling (GBP).

The firm must also buy USD to pay a major supplier. Goldsworthy calls Dealer A with specific details of the transaction and asks to verify the USD/GBP quote. Dealer A calls her back later with a revised USD/GBP bid/offer quote of 1.5760/1.5768.Goldsworthy must purchase MXN 27,000,000 to pay an invoice at the end of the quarter. In addition to the quotes from Dealer A, Underwood contacts Dealer B, who provides a bid/offer price of GBP/MXN 0.0366/0.0372. To check whether the dealer quotes are reflective of an efficient market, Underwood examines whether the prices allow for an arbitrage profit.In three months, the firm will receive EUR 5,000,000 (euros) from. another customer. Six months ago, the firm sold EUR 5,000,000 against the GBP using a nine-month forward contract at an all-in price of GBP/EUR 0.7400.
