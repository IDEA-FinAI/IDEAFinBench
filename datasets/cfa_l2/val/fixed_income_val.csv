0,"Lena Liecken is a senior bond analyst at Taurus Investment Management. Kristel Kreming, a junior analyst, works for Liecken in helping conduct fixed-income research for the firm's portfolio managers. Liecken and Kreming meet to discuss several bond positions held in the firm's portfolios.Bonds I and II both have a maturity of one year, an annual coupon rate of 5%, and a market price equal to par value. The risk-free rate is 3%. Historical default experiences of bonds comparable to Bonds I and II are presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1 | Credt Rsk Information for Comparable Bonds |
| Percentage of Bonds That |
| Survive and Make Full |
| Bond | Recovery Rate | Payment |
| I | 40% | 98% |
| Ⅱ | 35% | 99% |


Bond III is a zero-coupon bond with three years to maturity. Liecken evaluates sim- ilar bonds and estimates a recovery rate of 38% and a risk-neutral default probability of 2%, assuming conditional probabilities of default. Kreming creates Exhibit 2 to compute Bond III's credit valuation adjustment. She assumes a flat yield curve at 3%, with exposure, recovery, and loss given default values expressed per 100 of par value.

| Sum | 5.8808% | 3.5395 | 3.3367 |


Bond IV is an AA rated bond that matures in five years, has a coupon rate of 6%, and a modified duration of 4.2. Liecken is concerned about whether this bond will be downgraded to an A rating, but she does not expect the bond to default during the next year. Kreming constructs a partial transition matrix, which is presented in Exhibit 3, and suggests using a model to predict the rating change of Bond IV using leverage ratios, return on assets, and macroeconomic variables.

| Exhibit 3Pari alOne-Year Corporate Transition Matrix(entries in%) |

| From/To | AAA | AA | A |
| AAA | 92.00 | 6.00 | 1.00 |
| AA | 2.00 | 89.00 | 8.00 |
| A | 0.05 | 1.00 | 85.00 |
| Credit Spread(%) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 1.75 |


Kreming calculates the risk-neutral probabilities, compares them with the actual default probabilities of bonds evaluated over the past 10 years, and observes that the actual and risk-neutral probabilities differ. She makes two observations regarding the comparison of these probabilities:Observation 1: Actual default probabilities include the default risk premium associated with the uncertainty in the timing of the possible default loss.Observation 2: The observed spread over the yield on a risk-free bond in practice includes liquidity and tax considerations, in addition to credit risk.
Kreming's suggested model for Bond IV is a:",structural model.,reduced-form model.,term structure model.,,B
1,"UNAB CorporationOn 1 January 20X2, Deem Advisors purchased a $10 million six-year senior unsecured bond issued by UNAB Corporation. Six months later (1 July 20X2), concerned about the portfolio's credit exposure to UNAB, Doris Morrison, the chief investment officer at Deem Advisors, purchases a $10 million CDS with a standardized coupon rate of 5%. The reference obligation of the CDS is the UNAB bond owned by Deem Advisors.On 1 January 20X3, Morrison asks Bill Watt, a derivatives analyst, to assess the current credit quality of UNAB bonds and the value of Deem Advisor's CDS on UNAB debt. Watt gathers the following information on the UNAB's debt issues currently trading in the market:? Bond 1: A two-year senior unsecured bond trading at 40% of par? Bond 2: A six-year senior unsecured bond trading at 50% of par? Bond 3: A six-year subordinated unsecured bond trading at 20% of parWith respect to the credit quality of UNAB, Watt makes the following statement:“There is severe near-term stress in the financial markets and UNAB's credit curve clearly reflects the difficult environment.”On 1 July 20X3, UNAB fails to make a scheduled interest payment on the outstanding subordinated unsecured obligation after a grace period; however, the company does not file for bankruptcy. Morrison asks Watt to determine if UNAB experienced a credit event and, if so, to recommend a settlement preference.Kand CorporationMorrison is considering purchasing a 10-year CDS on Kand Corporation debt to hedge its current portfolio position. She instructs Watt to determine if an upfront payment would be required and, if so, the amount of the premium. Watt presents the information for the CDS in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Summary Data for 10-year CDS on K and Corporation |
| Credit spread | 700 basis points |
| Duration | 7 years |
| Coupon rate | 5% |


Morrison purchases the 10-year CDS on Kand Corporation debt. Two months later the credit spread for Kand Corp. has increased by 200 basis points. Morrison asks Watt to close out the firm's CDS position on Kand Corporation by entering into new offsetting contracts.Tollunt CorporationDeem Advisors' chief credit analyst recently reported that Tollunt Corporation's five-year bond is currently yielding 7% and a comparable CDS contract has a credit spread of 4.25%. Since Libor is 2.5%, Watt has recommended executing a basis trade to take advantage of the pricing of the Tollunt's bonds and CDS. The basis trade would consist of purchasing both the bond and the CDS contract.
Based on basis trade for Tollunt Corporation, if convergence occurs in the bond and CDS markets, the trade will capture a profit closest to:",0.25%.,1.75%.,2.75%.,,A
2,"John Smith, a fixed-income portfolio manager at a €10 billion sovereign wealth fund (the Fund), meets with Sofia Chan, a derivatives strategist with Shire Gate Securities (SGS), to discuss investment opportunities for the Fund. Chan notes that SGS adheres to ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) protocols for credit default swap (CDS) transactions and that any contract must conform to ISDA specifications. Before the Fund can engage in trading CDS products with SGS, the Fund must satisfy compliance requirements.Smith explains to Chan that fixed-income derivatives strategies are being contemplated for both hedging and trading purposes. Given the size and diversified nature of the Fund, Smith asks Chan to recommend a type of CDS that would allow the Fund to simultaneously fully hedge multiple fixed-income exposures.Smith and Chan discuss opportunities to add trading profits to the Fund. Smith asks Chan to determine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued by Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Selected Data on Orion Industrial Five-Year Bond |
| Year | Hazard Rate |
| 1 | 0.22% |
| 2 | 0.35% |
| 3 | 0.50% |
| 4 | 0.65% |
| 5 | 0.80% |


Chan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan describes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection on Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes the position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.Chan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential trades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global economies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.Outlook 1: The European economy will weaken.Outlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.Outlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of traditional car manufacturers.Chan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen in the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on her short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.Another short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and acquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a premium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market capitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered. It is anticipated that Delta will issue new equity along with 5- and 10-year senior unsecured debt to fund the acquisition, which will significantly increase its debt ratio.
To satisfy the compliance requirements referenced by Chan, the fund is most likely required to:",set a notional amount.,post an upfront payment.,sign an ISDA master agreement.,,C

5,"Rowan Madison is a junior analyst at Cardinal Capital. Sage Winter, a senior portfolio manager and Madison’s supervisor, meets with Madison to discuss interest rates and review two bond positions in the firm’s fixed-income portfolio.Winter begins the meeting by asking Madison to state her views on the term structure of interest rates. Madison responds:“Yields are a reflection of expected spot rates and risk premiums. Investors demand risk premiums for holding long-term bonds, and these risk premiums increase with maturity.”Winter tells Madison that, based on recent changes in spreads, she is concerned about a perceived increase in counterparty risk in the economy and its effect on the portfolio. Madison asks Winter:“Which spread measure should we use to assess changes in counterparty risk in the economy?”Winter is also worried about the effect of yield volatility on the portfolio. She asks Madison to identify the economic factors that affect short-term and long-term rate volatility. Madison responds:“Short-term rate volatility is mostly linked to uncertainty regarding monetary policy, whereas long-term rate volatility is mostly linked to uncertainty regarding the real economy and inflation.”Finally, Winter asks Madison to analyze the interest rate risk portfolio positions in a 5-year and a 20-year bond. Winter requests that the analysis be based on level, slope, and curvature as term structure factors. Madison presents her analysis in Exhibit 1.

10,"Liz Tyo is a fund manager for an actively managed global fixed-income fund that buys bonds issued in Countries A，B，and C. She and her assistant are preparing the quarterly markets update. Tyo begins the meeting by distributing the daily rates sheet, which includes the current government spot rates for Countries A, B, and C as shown in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l Today's Government Spot Rates |
| Maturity | Country A | Country B | Country C |
| One year | 0.40% | -0.22% | 14.00% |
| Two years | 0.70 | -0.20 | 12.40 |
| Three years | 1.00 | -0.12 | 11.80 |
| Four years | 1.30 | -0.02 | 11.00 |
| Five years | 1.50 | 0.13 | 10.70 |


Tyo asks her assistant how these spot rates were obtained. The assistant replies, “Spot rates are determined through the process of bootstrapping. It entails backward substitution using par yields to solve for zero-coupon rates one by one, in order from latest to earliest maturities.”Tyo then provides a review of the fund's performance during the last year and comments, “The choice of an appropriate benchmark depends on the country's characteristics. For example, although Countries A and B have both an active government bond market and a swap market, Country C's private sector is much bigger than its public sector, and its government bond market lacks liquidity.”Tyo further points out, “The fund's results were mixed; returns did not benefit from taking on additional risk. We are especially monitoring the riskiness of the corporate bond holdings. For example, our largest holdings consist of three four-year corporate bonds (Bonds 1, 2, and 3) with identical maturities, coupon rates, and other contract terms. These bonds have Z-spreads of 0.55%, 1.52%, and 1.76%, respectively:”Tyo continues, “We also look at risk in terms of the swap spread. We considered historical three-year swap spreads for Country B, which reflect that market's credit and liquidity risks, at three different points in time.” Tyo provides the information in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2 Selected Historical Three-Year Rates for Country B |
| Period | Govemment Bond Yield(%) | Fixed-for-Floating Libor Swap |

| 6 Month ago | -0.08 | 0.01 |
| 12 Month ago | -0.07 | 0.71 |


Tyo then suggests that the firm was able to add return by riding the yield curve. The fund plans to continue to use this strategy but only in markets with an attractive yield curve for this strategy.She moves on to present her market views on the respective yield curves for a five-year investment horizon.Country A: “The government yield curve has changed little in terms of its level and shape during the last few years, and 1 expect this trend to continue. We assume that future spot rates reflect the current forward curve for all maturities.”Countrγ B: “Because of recent economic trends, I expect a reversal in the slope of the current yield curve. We assume that future spot rates will be higher than current forward rates for all maturities.”Country C: ""To improve liquidity, Country C's central bank is expected to intervene, leading to a reversal in the slope of the existing yield curve. We assume that future spot rates will be lower than today's forward rates for all maturities.”Tyo's assistant asks, “Assuming investors require liquidity premiums, how can a yield curve slope downward? What does this imply about forward rates?""Tyo answers, “Even if investors require compensation for holding longer-term bonds, the yield curve can slope downward ----- for example, if there is an expectation of severe deflation. Regarding forward rates, it can be helpful to understand yield curve dynamics by calculating implied forward rates. To see what I mean, we can use Exhibit 1 to calculate the forward rate for a two-year Country C loan beginning in three years.”

11,"John Smith, a fixed-income portfolio manager at a €10 billion sovereign wealth fund (the Fund), meets with Sofia Chan, a derivatives strategist with Shire Gate Securities (SGS), to discuss investment opportunities for the Fund. Chan notes that SGS adheres to ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) protocols for credit default swap (CDS) transactions and that any contract must conform to ISDA specifications. Before the Fund can engage in trading CDS products with SGS, the Fund must satisfy compliance requirements.Smith explains to Chan that fixed-income derivatives strategies are being contemplated for both hedging and trading purposes. Given the size and diversified nature of the Fund, Smith asks Chan to recommend a type of CDS that would allow the Fund to simultaneously fully hedge multiple fixed-income exposures.Smith and Chan discuss opportunities to add trading profits to the Fund. Smith asks Chan to determine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued by Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Selected Data on Orion Industrial Five-Year Bond |
| Year | Hazard Rate |
| 1 | 0.22% |
| 2 | 0.35% |
| 3 | 0.50% |
| 4 | 0.65% |
| 5 | 0.80% |


Chan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan describes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection on Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes the position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.Chan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential trades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global economies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.Outlook 1: The European economy will weaken.Outlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.Outlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of traditional car manufacturers.Chan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen in the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on her short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.Another short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and acquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a premium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market capitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered. It is anticipated that Delta will issue new equity along with 5- and 10-year senior unsecured debt to fund the acquisition, which will significantly increase its debt ratio.
The hypothetical Orion trade generated an approximate:","loss of ￡117,000.","gain of ￡117,000.","gain of ￡234,000.",,B

Six months later (1 July 20X2), concerned about the portfolio's credit exposure to UNAB, Doris Morrison, the chief investment officer at Deem Advisors, purchases a $10 million CDS with a standardized coupon rate of 5%. The reference obligation of the CDS is the UNAB bond owned by Deem Advisors.On 1 January 20X3, Morrison asks Bill Watt, a derivatives analyst, to assess the current credit quality of UNAB bonds and the value of Deem Advisor's CDS on UNAB debt. Watt gathers the following information on the UNAB's debt issues currently trading in the market:? Bond 1: A two-year senior unsecured bond trading at 40% of par?

| Four years | 1.30 | -0.02 | 11.00 |
| Five years | 1.50 | 0.13 | 10.70 |


Tyo asks her assistant how these spot rates were obtained. The assistant replies, “Spot rates are determined through the process of bootstrapping. It entails backward substitution using par yields to solve for zero-coupon rates one by one, in order from latest to earliest maturities.”Tyo then provides a review of the fund's performance during the last year and comments, “The choice of an appropriate benchmark depends on the country's characteristics. For example, although Countries A and B have both an active government bond market and a swap market, Country C's private sector is much bigger than its public sector, and its government bond market lacks liquidity.”Tyo further points out, “The fund's results were mixed; returns did not benefit from taking on additional risk. We are especially monitoring the riskiness of the corporate bond holdings. For example, our largest holdings consist of three four-year corporate bonds (Bonds 1, 2, and 3) with identical maturities, coupon rates, and other contract terms.

Tyo then suggests that the firm was able to add return by riding the yield curve. The fund plans to continue to use this strategy but only in markets with an attractive yield curve for this strategy.She moves on to present her market views on the respective yield curves for a five-year investment horizon.Country A: “The government yield curve has changed little in terms of its level and shape during the last few years, and 1 expect this trend to continue. We assume that future spot rates reflect the current forward curve for all maturities.”Countrγ B: “Because of recent economic trends, I expect a reversal in the slope of the current yield curve. We assume that future spot rates will be higher than current forward rates for all maturities.”Country C: ""To improve liquidity, Country C's central bank is expected to intervene, leading to a reversal in the slope of the existing yield curve. We assume that future spot rates will be lower than today's forward rates for all maturities.”Tyo's assistant asks, “Assuming investors require liquidity premiums, how can a yield curve slope downward? What does this imply about forward rates?""Tyo answers, “Even if investors require compensation for holding longer-term bonds, the yield curve can slope downward ----- for example, if there is an expectation of severe deflation. Regarding forward rates, it can be helpful to understand yield curve dynamics by calculating implied forward rates. To see what I mean, we can use Exhibit 1 to calculate the forward rate for a two-year Country C loan beginning in three years.”

Six months later (1 July 20X2), concerned about the portfolio's credit exposure to UNAB, Doris Morrison, the chief investment officer at Deem Advisors, purchases a $10 million CDS with a standardized coupon rate of 5%. The reference obligation of the CDS is the UNAB bond owned by Deem Advisors.On 1 January 20X3, Morrison asks Bill Watt, a derivatives analyst, to assess the current credit quality of UNAB bonds and the value of Deem Advisor's CDS on UNAB debt. Watt gathers the following information on the UNAB's debt issues currently trading in the market:? Bond 1: A two-year senior unsecured bond trading at 40% of par? Bond 2: A six-year senior unsecured bond trading at 50% of par? Bond 3: A six-year subordinated unsecured bond trading at 20% of parWith respect to the credit quality of UNAB, Watt makes the following statement:“There is severe near-term stress in the financial markets and UNAB's credit curve clearly reflects the difficult environment.”On 1 July 20X3, UNAB fails to make a scheduled interest payment on the outstanding subordinated unsecured obligation after a grace period; however, the company does not file for bankruptcy. Morrison asks Watt to determine if UNAB experienced a credit event and, if so, to recommend a settlement preference.Kand CorporationMorrison is considering purchasing a 10-year CDS on Kand Corporation debt to hedge its current portfolio position. She instructs Watt to determine if an upfront payment would be required and, if so, the amount of the premium. Watt presents the information for the CDS in Exhibit 1.

Morrison purchases the 10-year CDS on Kand Corporation debt. Two months later the credit spread for Kand Corp. has increased by 200 basis points. Morrison asks Watt to close out the firm's CDS position on Kand Corporation by entering into new offsetting contracts.Tollunt CorporationDeem Advisors' chief credit analyst recently reported that Tollunt Corporation's five-year bond is currently yielding 7% and a comparable CDS contract has a credit spread of 4.25%. Since Libor is 2.5%, Watt has recommended executing a basis trade to take advantage of the pricing of the Tollunt's bonds and CDS. The basis trade would consist of purchasing both the bond and the CDS contract.

23,"Rowan Madison is a junior analyst at Cardinal Capital. Sage Winter, a senior portfolio manager and Madison’s supervisor, meets with Madison to discuss interest rates and review two bond positions in the firm’s fixed-income portfolio.Winter begins the meeting by asking Madison to state her views on the term structure of interest rates. Madison responds:“Yields are a reflection of expected spot rates and risk premiums. Investors demand risk premiums for holding long-term bonds, and these risk premiums increase with maturity.”Winter tells Madison that, based on recent changes in spreads, she is concerned about a perceived increase in counterparty risk in the economy and its effect on the portfolio. Madison asks Winter:“Which spread measure should we use to assess changes in counterparty risk in the economy?”Winter is also worried about the effect of yield volatility on the portfolio. She asks Madison to identify the economic factors that affect short-term and long-term rate volatility. Madison responds:“Short-term rate volatility is mostly linked to uncertainty regarding monetary policy, whereas long-term rate volatility is mostly linked to uncertainty regarding the real economy and inflation.”Finally, Winter asks Madison to analyze the interest rate risk portfolio positions in a 5-year and a 20-year bond. Winter requests that the analysis be based on level, slope, and curvature as term structure factors. Madison presents her analysis in Exhibit 1.

| Curvature | 0.3963% | 0.5227% |
| Note：Entries indicate how yields would change for a one standard deviation increase in a |

Winter asks Madison to perform two analyses:Analysis 1: Calculate the expected change in yield on the 20-year bond resulting from a two standard deviation increase in the steepness factor.Analysis 2: Calculate the expected change in yield on the five-year bond resulting from a one standard deviation decrease in the level factor and a one standard deviation decrease in the curvature factor.

Bond IV is an AA rated bond that matures in five years, has a coupon rate of 6%, and a modified duration of 4.2. Liecken is concerned about whether this bond will be downgraded to an A rating, but she does not expect the bond to default during the next year. Kreming constructs a partial transition matrix, which is presented in Exhibit 3, and suggests using a model to predict the rating change of Bond IV using leverage ratios, return on assets, and macroeconomic variables.

Kreming calculates the risk-neutral probabilities, compares them with the actual default probabilities of bonds evaluated over the past 10 years, and observes that the actual and risk-neutral probabilities differ. She makes two observations regarding the comparison of these probabilities:Observation 1: Actual default probabilities include the default risk premium associated with the uncertainty in the timing of the possible default loss.Observation 2: The observed spread over the yield on a risk-free bond in practice includes liquidity and tax considerations, in addition to credit risk.

Lastly, Tatton identifies two mispriced Swiss bonds, Bond X, a three-year bond, and Bond Y, a five-year bond. Both are annual-pay bonds with a coupon rate of 6%. To calculate the bonds’ values, Tatton devises the first three years of the interest rate lognormal tree presented in Exhibit 4 using historical interest rate volatility data. Tatton considers how this data would change if implied volatility, which is higher than historical volatility, were used instead.

Tatton is responsible for pricing individual investments and analyzing market data to assess the opportunity for arbitrage. She uses two methods to value bonds:Method 1: Discount each year’s cash flow separately using the appropriate interest rate curve.Method 2: Build and use a binomial interest rate tree.Tatton compiles pricing data for a list of annual pay bonds (Exhibit 1). Each of the bonds will mature in two years, and Tatton considers the bonds as being risk-free; both the one-year and two-year benchmark spot rates are 2%. Tatton calculates the arbitrage-free prices and identifies an arbitrage opportunity to recommend to her team.

Six months later (1 July 20X2), concerned about the portfolio's credit exposure to UNAB, Doris Morrison, the chief investment officer at Deem Advisors, purchases a $10 million CDS with a standardized coupon rate of 5%. The reference obligation of the CDS is the UNAB bond owned by Deem Advisors.On 1 January 20X3, Morrison asks Bill Watt, a derivatives analyst, to assess the current credit quality of UNAB bonds and the value of Deem Advisor's CDS on UNAB debt. Watt gathers the following information on the UNAB's debt issues currently trading in the market:? Bond 1: A two-year senior unsecured bond trading at 40% of par? Bond 2: A six-year senior unsecured bond trading at 50% of par? Bond 3: A six-year subordinated unsecured bond trading at 20% of parWith respect to the credit quality of UNAB, Watt makes the following statement:“There is severe near-term stress in the financial markets and UNAB's credit curve clearly reflects the difficult environment.”On 1 July 20X3, UNAB fails to make a scheduled interest payment on the outstanding subordinated unsecured obligation after a grace period; however, the company does not file for bankruptcy. Morrison asks Watt to determine if UNAB experienced a credit event and, if so, to recommend a settlement preference.Kand CorporationMorrison is considering purchasing a 10-year CDS on Kand Corporation debt to hedge its current portfolio position. She instructs Watt to determine if an upfront payment would be required and, if so, the amount of the premium. Watt presents the information for the CDS in Exhibit 1.

Morrison purchases the 10-year CDS on Kand Corporation debt. Two months later the credit spread for Kand Corp. has increased by 200 basis points. Morrison asks Watt to close out the firm's CDS position on Kand Corporation by entering into new offsetting contracts.Tollunt CorporationDeem Advisors' chief credit analyst recently reported that Tollunt Corporation's five-year bond is currently yielding 7% and a comparable CDS contract has a credit spread of 4.25%. Since Libor is 2.5%, Watt has recommended executing a basis trade to take advantage of the pricing of the Tollunt's bonds and CDS. The basis trade would consist of purchasing both the bond and the CDS contract.

38,"Rowan Madison is a junior analyst at Cardinal Capital. Sage Winter, a senior portfolio manager and Madison’s supervisor, meets with Madison to discuss interest rates and review two bond positions in the firm’s fixed-income portfolio.Winter begins the meeting by asking Madison to state her views on the term structure of interest rates. Madison responds:“Yields are a reflection of expected spot rates and risk premiums. Investors demand risk premiums for holding long-term bonds, and these risk premiums increase with maturity.”Winter tells Madison that, based on recent changes in spreads, she is concerned about a perceived increase in counterparty risk in the economy and its effect on the portfolio. Madison asks Winter:“Which spread measure should we use to assess changes in counterparty risk in the economy?”Winter is also worried about the effect of yield volatility on the portfolio. She asks Madison to identify the economic factors that affect short-term and long-term rate volatility. Madison responds:“Short-term rate volatility is mostly linked to uncertainty regarding monetary policy, whereas long-term rate volatility is mostly linked to uncertainty regarding the real economy and inflation.”Finally, Winter asks Madison to analyze the interest rate risk portfolio positions in a 5-year and a 20-year bond. Winter requests that the analysis be based on level, slope, and curvature as term structure factors. Madison presents her analysis in Exhibit 1.

Chan notes that SGS adheres to ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) protocols for credit default swap (CDS) transactions and that any contract must conform to ISDA specifications. Before the Fund can engage in trading CDS products with SGS, the Fund must satisfy compliance requirements.Smith explains to Chan that fixed-income derivatives strategies are being contemplated for both hedging and trading purposes. Given the size and diversified nature of the Fund, Smith asks Chan to recommend a type of CDS that would allow the Fund to simultaneously fully hedge multiple fixed-income exposures.Smith and Chan discuss opportunities to add trading profits to the Fund. Smith asks Chan to determine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued by Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.

Chan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan describes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection on Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes the position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.Chan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential trades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global economies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.Outlook 1: The European economy will weaken.Outlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.Outlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of traditional car manufacturers.Chan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen in the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on her short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.Another short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and acquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a premium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market capitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered. It is anticipated that Delta will issue new equity along with 5- and 10-year senior unsecured debt to fund the acquisition, which will significantly increase its debt ratio.

Tyo begins the meeting by distributing the daily rates sheet, which includes the current government spot rates for Countries A, B, and C as shown in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l Today's Government Spot Rates |
| Maturity | Country A | Country B | Country C |
| One year | 0.40% | -0.22% | 14.00% |
| Two years | 0.70 | -0.20 | 12.40 |
| Three years | 1.00 | -0.12 | 11.80 |
| Four years | 1.30 | -0.02 | 11.00 |
| Five years | 1.50 | 0.13 | 10.70 |


Tyo asks her assistant how these spot rates were obtained. The assistant replies, “Spot rates are determined through the process of bootstrapping. It entails backward substitution using par yields to solve for zero-coupon rates one by one, in order from latest to earliest maturities.”Tyo then provides a review of the fund's performance during the last year and comments, “The choice of an appropriate benchmark depends on the country's characteristics. For example, although Countries A and B have both an active government bond market and a swap market, Country C's private sector is much bigger than its public sector, and its government bond market lacks liquidity.”Tyo further points out, “The fund's results were mixed; returns did not benefit from taking on additional risk. We are especially monitoring the riskiness of the corporate bond holdings. For example, our largest holdings consist of three four-year corporate bonds (Bonds 1, 2, and 3) with identical maturities, coupon rates, and other contract terms. These bonds have Z-spreads of 0.55%, 1.52%, and 1.76%, respectively:”Tyo continues, “We also look at risk in terms of the swap spread. We considered historical three-year swap spreads for Country B, which reflect that market's credit and liquidity risks, at three different points in time.” Tyo provides the information in Exhibit 2.
| Exhibit 2 Selected Historical Three-Year Rates for Country B |
| Period | Govemment Bond Yield(%) | Fixed-for-Floating Libor Swap |

| 1 Month ago | -0.10 | 0.16 |
| 6 Month ago | -0.08 | 0.01 |
| 12 Month ago | -0.07 | 0.71 |


Tyo then suggests that the firm was able to add return by riding the yield curve. The fund plans to continue to use this strategy but only in markets with an attractive yield curve for this strategy.She moves on to present her market views on the respective yield curves for a five-year investment horizon.Country A: “The government yield curve has changed little in terms of its level and shape during the last few years, and 1 expect this trend to continue. We assume that future spot rates reflect the current forward curve for all maturities.”Countrγ B: “Because of recent economic trends, I expect a reversal in the slope of the current yield curve. We assume that future spot rates will be higher than current forward rates for all maturities.”Country C: ""To improve liquidity, Country C's central bank is expected to intervene, leading to a reversal in the slope of the existing yield curve. We assume that future spot rates will be lower than today's forward rates for all maturities.”Tyo's assistant asks, “Assuming investors require liquidity premiums, how can a yield curve slope downward? What does this imply about forward rates?""Tyo answers, “Even if investors require compensation for holding longer-term bonds, the yield curve can slope downward ----- for example, if there is an expectation of severe deflation. Regarding forward rates, it can be helpful to understand yield curve dynamics by calculating implied forward rates. To see what I mean, we can use Exhibit 1 to calculate the forward rate for a two-year Country C loan beginning in three years.”

To assess the interest rate risk of the three bonds, Bianchi constructs two binomial interest rate trees based on a 10% interest rate volatility assumption and a current one-year rate of 1%. Panel A of Exhibit 2 provides an interest rate tree assuming the benchmark yield curve shifts down by 30 bps, and Panel B provides an interest rate tree assuming the benchmark yield curve shifts up by 30 bps. Bianchi determines that the AI bond is currently trading at an option-adjusted spread (OAS) of 13.95 bps relative to the benchmark yield curve.

She uses two methods to value bonds:Method 1: Discount each year’s cash flow separately using the appropriate interest rate curve.Method 2: Build and use a binomial interest rate tree.Tatton compiles pricing data for a list of annual pay bonds (Exhibit 1). Each of the bonds will mature in two years, and Tatton considers the bonds as being risk-free; both the one-year and two-year benchmark spot rates are 2%. Tatton calculates the arbitrage-free prices and identifies an arbitrage opportunity to recommend to her team.

Lastly, Tatton identifies two mispriced Swiss bonds, Bond X, a three-year bond, and Bond Y, a five-year bond. Both are annual-pay bonds with a coupon rate of 6%. To calculate the bonds’ values, Tatton devises the first three years of the interest rate lognormal tree presented in Exhibit 4 using historical interest rate volatility data. Tatton considers how this data would change if implied volatility, which is higher than historical volatility, were used instead.

Kreming calculates the risk-neutral probabilities, compares them with the actual default probabilities of bonds evaluated over the past 10 years, and observes that the actual and risk-neutral probabilities differ. She makes two observations regarding the comparison of these probabilities:Observation 1: Actual default probabilities include the default risk premium associated with the uncertainty in the timing of the possible default loss.Observation 2: The observed spread over the yield on a risk-free bond in practice includes liquidity and tax considerations, in addition to credit risk.

Smith asks Chan to determine the probability of default associated with a five-year investment-grade bond issued by Orion Industrial. Selected data on the Orion Industrial bond are presented in Exhibit 1.

Chan explains that a single-name CDS can also be used to add profit to the Fund over time. Chan describes a hypothetical trade in which the Fund sells ￡6 million of five-year CDS protection on Orion, where the CDS contract has a duration of 3.9 years. Chan assumes that the Fund closes the position six months later, after Orion’s credit spread narrowed from 150 bps to 100 bps.Chan discusses the mechanics of a long/short trade. In order to structure a number of potential trades, Chan and Smith exchange their respective views on individual companies and global economies. Chan and Smith agree on the following outlooks.Outlook 1: The European economy will weaken.Outlook 2: The US economy will strengthen relative to that of Canada.Outlook 3: The credit quality of electric car manufacturers will improve relative to that of traditional car manufacturers.Chan believes US macroeconomic data are improving and that the general economy will strengthen in the short term. Chan suggests that a curve trade could be used by the Fund to capitalize on her short-term view of a steepening of the US credit curve.Another short-term trading opportunity that Smith and Chan discuss involves the merger and acquisition market. SGS believes that Delta Corporation may make an unsolicited bid at a premium to the market price for all of the publicly traded shares of Zega, Inc. Zega’s market capitalization and capital structure are comparable to Delta’s; both firms are highly levered. It is anticipated that Delta will issue new equity along with 5- and 10-year senior unsecured debt to fund the acquisition, which will significantly increase its debt ratio.
To close the position on the hypothetical Orion trade, the Fund:",sells protection at a higher premium than it paid at the start of the trade.,buys protection at a lower premium than it received at the start of the trade.,buys protection at a higher premium than it received at the start of the trade.,,B

60,"UNAB CorporationOn 1 January 20X2, Deem Advisors purchased a $10 million six-year senior unsecured bond issued by UNAB Corporation. Six months later (1 July 20X2), concerned about the portfolio's credit exposure to UNAB, Doris Morrison, the chief investment officer at Deem Advisors, purchases a $10 million CDS with a standardized coupon rate of 5%. The reference obligation of the CDS is the UNAB bond owned by Deem Advisors.On 1 January 20X3, Morrison asks Bill Watt, a derivatives analyst, to assess the current credit quality of UNAB bonds and the value of Deem Advisor's CDS on UNAB debt. Watt gathers the following information on the UNAB's debt issues currently trading in the market:? Bond 1: A two-year senior unsecured bond trading at 40% of par? Bond 2: A six-year senior unsecured bond trading at 50% of par? Bond 3: A six-year subordinated unsecured bond trading at 20% of parWith respect to the credit quality of UNAB, Watt makes the following statement:“There is severe near-term stress in the financial markets and UNAB's credit curve clearly reflects the difficult environment.”On 1 July 20X3, UNAB fails to make a scheduled interest payment on the outstanding subordinated unsecured obligation after a grace period; however, the company does not file for bankruptcy. Morrison asks Watt to determine if UNAB experienced a credit event and, if so, to recommend a settlement preference.Kand CorporationMorrison is considering purchasing a 10-year CDS on Kand Corporation debt to hedge its current portfolio position. She instructs Watt to determine if an upfront payment would be required and, if so, the amount of the premium. Watt presents the information for the CDS in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1.Summary Data for 10-year CDS on K and Corporation |

Morrison purchases the 10-year CDS on Kand Corporation debt. Two months later the credit spread for Kand Corp. has increased by 200 basis points. Morrison asks Watt to close out the firm's CDS position on Kand Corporation by entering into new offsetting contracts.Tollunt CorporationDeem Advisors' chief credit analyst recently reported that Tollunt Corporation's five-year bond is currently yielding 7% and a comparable CDS contract has a credit spread of 4.25%. Since Libor is 2.5%, Watt has recommended executing a basis trade to take advantage of the pricing of the Tollunt's bonds and CDS. The basis trade would consist of purchasing both the bond and the CDS contract.
