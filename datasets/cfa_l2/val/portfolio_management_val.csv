0,"Kata Rom is an equity analyst working for Gimingham Wealth Partners (GWP), a large investment advisory company. Rom meets with Goran Galic, a Canadian private wealth client, to explain investment strategies used by GWP to generate portfolio alpha for its clients.Rom states that GWP is recognized in the Canadian investment industry as a leading factor-based value portfolio manager and describes how GWP creates relevant investment strategies and explains GWP’s backtesting process. Rom notes the following:Statement 1: Using historical data, backtesting approximates a real-life investment process to illustrate the risk–return tradeoff of a particular proposed investment strategy.Statement 2: Backtesting is used almost exclusively by quantitative investment managers and rarely by fundamental investment managers, who are more concerned with information such as forward estimates of company earnings, macroeconomic factors, and intrinsic values.Galic, who is 62 years old, decides to allocate C$2 million (representing 10% of his net worth) to an account with GWP and stipulates that portfolio assets be restricted exclusively to domestic securities. Although GWP has not backtested its strategies with such a restriction, it has backtested its strategies using a global index that includes domestic securities. Rom shows the following risk measures to Galic for three factor portfolios.
| Exhibit 1Downside Risk Measures for Model Factors |
| Risk Measure | Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |
| Value at risk(VaR)(95%) | (6.49%) | (0.77%) | (2.40%) |
| Conditional VaR(CVaR) (95%) | (15.73%) | (4.21%) | (3.24%) |
| Maximum drawdown | 35.10% | 38.83% | 45.98% |


Galic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the following replies:Statement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a weakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in particular may not capture extreme downside risk.Statement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of financial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.In an effort to make Galic fully aware of the risks inherent in GWP’s strategies, Rom describes a recent study that investigated the return distributions of value and momentum factors that GWP uses to construct portfolios. The study found that these distributions were non-normal based on their negative skewness, excess kurtosis, and tail dependence. Rom indicated that investment strategies based on this type of data are prone to significantly higher downside risk. Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as scenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2 compares the performance of two of GWP’s factor allocation strategies in different regimes:

| Strategy/Regime | HighVolatility | LowVolatility | Recession | Non-recession |
| Strategy I | 0.88 | 0.64 | 0.20 | 1.00 |
| Strategy II | 1.56 | 1.60 | 1.76 | 1.52 |


Galic is surprised to see that some of the backtest results are unfavorable. He asks,“Why has GWP not considered strategies that perform better in backtesting?” Galic recently met with Fastlane Wealth Managers, who showed much better performance results. The portfolio manager at Fastlane told Galic that the company selects the top-performing strategies after performing thousands of backtests.

2,"Randy Gorver, chief risk officer at Eastern Regional Bank, and John Abell, assistant risk officer, are currently conducting a risk assessment of several of the bank's independent investment functions. These reviews include the bank's fixed-income investment portfolio and an equity fund managed by the bank's trust department. Gorver and Abell are also assessing Eastern Regional's overall risk exposure.Eastern Regional Bank Fixed-Income Investment PortfolioThe bank's proprietary fixed-income portfolio is structured as a barbell portfolio: About half of the portfolio is invested in zero-coupon Treasuries with maturities in the 3- to 5-year range (Portfolio P1), and the remainder is invested in zero-coupon Treasuries with maturities in the 10- to 15-year range (Portfolio P2. Georges Montes, the portfolio manager, has discretion to allocate between 40% and 60% of the assets to each maturity “bucket” He must remain fully invested at all times. Exhibit 1 shows details of this portfolio.

Trust Department's Equity Funda) Use of Options: The trust department of Eastern Regional Bank manages an equity fund called the Index Plus Fund, with $325 million in assets. This fund's objective is to track the S&P 500 Index price return while producing an income return 1.5 times that of the S&P 500. The bank's chief investment officer (CIO) uses put and call options on S&P 500 stock index futures to adjust the risk exposure of certain client accounts that have an investment in this fund. The portfolio of a 60-year-old widow with a below-average risk tolerance has an investment in this fund, and the CIO has asked his assistant, Janet Ferrell, to propose an options strategy to bring the portfolio's delta to 0.90.b) Value at Risk: The Index Plus Fund has a one-day 95% value at risk (VaR) of $6.5 million. Gorver asks Abell to write a brief summary of the portfolio VaR for the report he is preparing on the fund's risk position.Combined Bank Risk ExposuresThe bank has adopted a new risk policy, which requires forward-looking risk assessments in addition to the measures that look at historical risk characteristics. Management has also become very focused on tail risk since the subprime crisis and is evaluating the bank's capital allocation to certain higher-risk lines of business. Gorver must determine what additional risk metrics to include in his risk reporting to address the new policy. He asks Abell to draft a section of the risk report that will address the risk measures' adequacy for capital allocation decisions.

3,"Emily Yuen is a senior analyst for a consulting firm that specializes in assessing equity strategies using backtesting and simulation techniques. She is working with an assistant, Cameron Ruckey, to develop multifactor portfolio strategies based on nine factors common to the growth style of investing. To do so, Yuen and Ruckey plan to construct nine separate factor portfolios and then use them to create factor-weighted allocation portfolios.Yuen tasks Ruckey with specifying the investment universe and determining the availability of appropriate reporting data in vendor databases. Ruckey selects a vendor database that does not provide point-in-time data, so he adjusts the database to include point-in-time constituent stocks and a reporting lag of four months.Next, Yuen and Ruckey run initial backtests on the nine factor portfolios, calculating performance statistics and key metrics for each. For backtesting purposes, the portfolios are rebalanced monthly over a 30-year time horizon using a rolling-window procedure.Yuen and Ruckey consider a variety of metrics to assess the results of the factor portfolio backtests. Yuen asks Ruckey what can be concluded from the data for three of the factor strategies in Exhibit 1:
| Exhibit 1Back test Metrics for Factor Strategies |
| Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |
| VaR(95%) | (3.9%) | (1.3%) | (8.4%) |
| Standard deviation ofreturns | 2.1% | 1.2% | 4.6% |
| Maximum drawdown | 27.2% | 8.3% | 59.7% |


Ruckey tells Yuen the following:Statement 1: We do not need to consider maximum drawdown, because standard deviation sufficiently characterizes risk.Statement 2: Factor 2 has the highest downside risk.From her professional experience Yuen knows that benchmark and risk parity factor portfolios, in which factors are equally weighted and equally risk weighted, respectively, are popular with institutional and high-net-worth clients. To gain a more complete picture of these investment strategies’ performance, Yuen and Ruckey design a Benchmark Portfolio (A) and a Risk Parity Portfolio (B), and then run two simulation methods to generate investment performance data based on the underlying factor portfolios, assuming 1,000 simulation trials for each approach:Approach 1: Historical simulationApproach 2: Monte Carlo simulation.Yuen and Ruckey discuss the differences between the two approaches and then design the simulations, making key decisions at various steps. During the process, Yuen expresses a number of concerns:Concern 1: Returns from six of the nine factors are correlated.Concern 2: The distribution of Factor 1 returns exhibits excess kurtosis and negative skewness.Concern 3: The number of simulations needed for Approach 1 is larger than the size of the historical dataset.For each approach, Yuen and Ruckey run 1,000 trials to obtain 1,000 returns for Portfolios A and B. To help understand the effect of the skewness and excess kurtosis observed in the Factor 1 returns on the performance of Portfolios A and B, Ruckey suggests simulating an additional 1,000 factor returns using a multivariate skewed Student’s t-distribution, then repeating the Approach 2 simulation.

4,"Julie Carlisle is a financial planner at a large wealth management firm. One of her clients, Esteban Blake, just received a sizable inheritance. He invests a portion of the inheritance in an annuity that will immediately increase his income by a substantial amount. He enlists Carlisle's help to invest the remaining amount of the inheritance.Blake informs Carlisle he would like some short-term bonds in his portfolio. Carlisle proposes purchasing a one-year domestic government zero-coupon bond. 1t has a face value of $100 and is currently priced at $96.37. Carlisle estimates the one-year real risk-free rate at 1.15% and expects inflation over the next year to be 2.25%.In an effort to provide Blake with some exposure to international markets, Carlisle proposes three countries to look for investment opportunities. Selected data on the three countries are presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit l.Selected Macroeconomic Data |
| NominalGDPGrowth | InflationRate | Volatility ofReal GDPGrowth | Yield CurveShape | Trailing12-Month EquityIndex P/E |
| Country # 1 | 6.5% | 4.0% | Flat | 16.5 |
| Country # 2 | 5.0% | 2.5% | High | Upward slope | 17.3 |
| Country # 3 | 3.5% | 2.0% | Low | Flat | 18.2 |


In her analysis, Carlisle observes that the spread between the three-year default- free nominal bond and the default-free real zero-coupon bond in Country #3 is 2.0%.Blake expresses concern that stocks may be currently overvalued in Country #3 given the country's 20-year historical equity index P/E of 16.0. Carlisle comments:I think the equilibrium P/E in Country #3 has increased because of changes in market conditions.Carlisle predicts that Country #3 wil1 slip into a recession next quarter. She thinks it will be short-lived, lasting only 12 months or so, and considers the impact of such a recession on the performance of the country’s stocks and bonds.

5,"Carlos Altuve is a manager-of-managers at an investment company that uses quantitative models extensively. Altuve seeks to construct a multi-manager portfolio using some of the funds managed by portfolio managers within the firm. Maya Zapata is assisting him.Altuve uses arbitrage pricing theory (APT) as a basis for evaluating strategies and managing risks. From his earlier analysis, Zapata knows that Funds A and B in Exhibit 1 are well diversified. He has not previously worked with Fund C and is puzzled by the data because it is inconsistent with APT. He asks Zapata gather additional information on Fund C's holdings and to determine if an arbitrage opportunity exists among these three investment alternatives. Her analysis, using the data in Exhibit 1, confirms that an arbitrage opportunity does exist.

| Fund | Expected Return | Factor Sensitivity |
| A | 0.02 | 0.5 |
| B | 0.04 | 1.5 |
| C | 0.03 | 0.9 |


The manager of Fund C makes some modifications to his portfolio and eliminates the arbitrage opportunity. Using a two-factor model, Zapata now estimates the three funds'sensitivity to inflation and GDP growth. That information is presented in Exhibit 2. Zapata assumes a zero value for the error terms when working with the selected two-factor model.

Johnson explains to Martin that the number of venues trading the same instruments has proliferated in recent years, and trading in any given instrument has now been distributed across these multiple venues. As a result, the available liquidity on any one of those exchanges represents just a small portion of the aggregate liquidity for that security. As a result, SAMN has had to adapt its trading strategies, particularly for large trades.Johnson asks Martin about his views on how the introduction of electronic trading might have impacted SAMN. Martin tells Johnson:Statement 1 Once built, electronic trading systems are more efficient and cheaper to operate than floor-based trading systems.Statement 2 Electronic trading systems have attracted a lot of new buy-side traders, and the increased competition has resulted in narrower bid–ask spreads.Statement 3 The introduction of electronic markets has had a much greater impact on the trading of corporate and municipal bonds than on the trading of equities.Johnson tells Martin that communication speed is SAMN's current highest prior-ity. All of SAMN's competitors have increased their communication speeds in recent months, and Johnson says management wants SAMN to be faster than its competi-tors. SAMN's trading desk is located in a residential area far from downtown where the exchanges it works with are located. SAMN's trading team is relatively large with experienced investment professionals, and the firm recently invested in fast computers with the latest algorithms.At the end of the training, Johnson gives Martin his first assignment. The assign-ment is for Martin to use the vast amount of data that SAMN has collected to design a machine learning (ML) model using advanced statistical methods to characterize data structures and relations. Then he has to build a trading algorithm based on the same model. Since electronic trading has added systemic risk to the market, Johnson asks Martin to suggest ways to minimize the systemic risk introduced by his algorithm. Martin offers two suggestions:Suggestion 1 Perform extensive testing of the algorithm before its launch.Suggestion 2 Impose mandatory trading halts if prices change outside a threshold range.A month into the job, Johnson sends Martin to an investment conference focused on abusive trading practices. Based on what he learned at the conference, Martin recommends to Johnson that SAMN incorporate a new rule that news be validated before a trade triggered by news is executed.
Based on Exhibit 2, the average effective spread of the three trades is closest to:",$0.0333.,$0.0367.,$0.0400.,,C
12,"Tina Ming is a senior portfolio manager at Flusk Pension Fund (Flusk). Flusk's portfolio is composed of fixed-income instruments structured to match Flusk's liabilities.Ming works with Shrikant McKee, Flusk's risk analyst. Ming and McKee discuss the latest risk report. McKee calculated value at risk (VaR) for the entire portfolio using the historical method and assuming a lookback period of five years and 250 trading days per year. McKee presents VaR measures in Exhibit 1. ]
| Exhibit 1 | F lusk Portfolio VaR(in$millions) |
| Confidence Interval | Daily VaR | Monthly VaR |
| 95% | 1.10 | 5.37 |


After reading McKee's report, Ming asks why the number of daily VaR breaches over the last year is zero even though the portfolio has accumulated a substantial loss.Next Ming requests that McKee perform the following two risk analyses on Flusk's portfolio:Analysis 1 Use scenario analysis to evaluate the impact on risk and return of a repeat of the last financial crisis.Analysis 2 Estimate over one year, with a 95% level of confidence, how much Flusk's assets could underperform its liabilities.Ming recommends purchasing newly issued emerging market corporate bonds that have embedded options. Prior to buying the bonds, Ming wants McKee to estimate the effect of the purchase on Flusk's VaR. McKee suggests running a stress test using a historical period specific to emerging markets that encompassed an extreme change in credit spreads.At the conclusion of their conversation, Ming asks the following question about risk management tools: “What are the advantages of VaR compared with other risk measures?”
Based on Exhibit 1, Flusk' portfolio is expected to experience:",a minimum daily loss of $1.10 million over the next year.,a loss over one month equal to or exceeding $5.37 million 5% of the time.,an average daily loss of $1.10 million 5% of the time during the next 250 trading days.,,B
13,"Kata Rom is an equity analyst working for Gimingham Wealth Partners (GWP), a large investment advisory company. Rom meets with Goran Galic, a Canadian private wealth client, to explain investment strategies used by GWP to generate portfolio alpha for its clients.Rom states that GWP is recognized in the Canadian investment industry as a leading factor-based value portfolio manager and describes how GWP creates relevant investment strategies and explains GWP’s backtesting process. Rom notes the following:Statement 1: Using historical data, backtesting approximates a real-life investment process to illustrate the risk–return tradeoff of a particular proposed investment strategy.Statement 2: Backtesting is used almost exclusively by quantitative investment managers and rarely by fundamental investment managers, who are more concerned with information such as forward estimates of company earnings, macroeconomic factors, and intrinsic values.Galic, who is 62 years old, decides to allocate C$2 million (representing 10% of his net worth) to an account with GWP and stipulates that portfolio assets be restricted exclusively to domestic securities. Although GWP has not backtested its strategies with such a restriction, it has backtested its strategies using a global index that includes domestic securities. Rom shows the following risk measures to Galic for three factor portfolios.
| Exhibit 1Downside Risk Measures for Model Factors |
| Risk Measure | Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |
| Value at risk(VaR)(95%) | (6.49%) | (0.77%) | (2.40%) |

| Maximum drawdown | 35.10% | 38.83% | 45.98% |


Galic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the following replies:Statement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a weakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in particular may not capture extreme downside risk.Statement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of financial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.In an effort to make Galic fully aware of the risks inherent in GWP’s strategies, Rom describes a recent study that investigated the return distributions of value and momentum factors that GWP uses to construct portfolios. The study found that these distributions were non-normal based on their negative skewness, excess kurtosis, and tail dependence. Rom indicated that investment strategies based on this type of data are prone to significantly higher downside risk. Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as scenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2 compares the performance of two of GWP’s factor allocation strategies in different regimes:
| Exhibit 2Scenario Analysis Using the Sharpe Ratio |

Galic is surprised to see that some of the backtest results are unfavorable. He asks,“Why has GWP not considered strategies that perform better in backtesting?” Galic recently met with Fastlane Wealth Managers, who showed much better performance results. The portfolio manager at Fastlane told Galic that the company selects the top-performing strategies after performing thousands of backtests.
Which of the following conclusions of Exhibit 1 is least likely to be true?","5% of the time, losses from Factor 1 would be at least 6.49%.","When the VaR is exceeded in Factor 1, we should expect an average loss of 15.73%.","5% of the time, losses from Factor 2 are likely to be worse than losses from Factor 1.",,C
14,"Hiram Life (Hiram), a large multinational insurer located in Canada, has received permission to increase its ownership in an India-based life insurance company, LICIA, from 26% to 49%. Before completing this transaction, Hiram wants to complete a risk assessment of LICIA's investment portfolio. Judith Hamilton, Hiram's chief financial officer, has been asked to brief the management committee on investment risk in its India-based insurance operations.LICIA's portfolio, which has a market value of CAD 260 million, is currently structured as shown in Exhibit 1. Despite its more than 1,000 individual holdings, the portfolio is invested predominantly in India. The Indian government bond market is highly liquid, but the country's mortgage and infrastructure loan markets, as well as the corporate bond market, are relatively illiquid. Individual mortgage and corporate bond positions are large relative to the normal trading volumes in these securities. Given the elevated current and fiscal account deficits, Indian investments are also subject to above-average economic risk.Hamilton begins with a summary of the India-based portfolio. Exhibit 1 presents the current portfolio composition and the risk and return assumptions used to esti?mate value at risk (VaR).
| Exhibit l.Selected Assumptions for LICIA's Investment Portfolio |
| Allocation | Average Daily | Daily Standard |
| Return | Deviation |
| India govemment securities | 50% | 0.015% | 0.206% |
| India mortgage/infrastructure loans | 25% | 0.045% | 0.710% |
| India corporate bonds | 15% | 0.025% | 0.324% |
| India equity | 10% | 0.035% | 0.996% |


Infrastructure is a rapidly growing asset class with limited return history; the first infrastructure loans were issued just 10 years ago.Hamilton's report to the management committee must outline her assumptions and provide support for the methods she used in her risk assessment. If needed, she will also make recommendations for rebalancing the portfolio to ensure its risk profile is aligned with that of Hiram.Hamilton develops the assumptions shown in Exhibit 2, which will be used for estimating the portfolio VaR.

| Para metic approach | 0.026% | 0.501% |
| Historical simulation | 0.023% | 0.490% |


Hamilton elects to apply a one-day, 5% VaR limit of CAD 2 million in her risk assessment of LICIA,s portfolio. This limit is consistent with the risk tolerance the committee has specified for the Hiram portfolio.The markets' volatility during the last 12 months has been significantly higher than the historical norm, with increased frequency of large daily losses, and Hamilton expects the next 12 months to be equally volatile.She estimates the one-day 5% portfolio VaR for LICIA's portfolio using three different approaches:

| MonteCarlo simulation | CAD 2， 095， 565 |
| Parametric approach | CAD 2， 083， 610 |
| Historic simulation | CAD 1， 938， 874 |


The committee is likely to have questions in a number of key areas—the limitations of the VaR report, potential losses in an extreme adverse event, and the reliability of the VaR numbers if the market continues to exhibit higher-than-normal volatility. Hamilton wants to be certain that she has thoroughly evaluated the risks inherent in the LICIA portfolio and compares them with the risks in Hiram's present portfolio.Hamilton believes the possibility of a ratings downgrade on Indian sovereign debt is high and not yet fully reflected in securities prices. If the rating is lowered, many of the portfolio's holdings will no longer meet Hiram's minimum ratings requirement. A downgrade's effect is unlikely to be limited to the government bond portfolio. All asset classes can be expected to be affected to some degree. Hamilton plans to include a scenario analysis that reflects this possibility to ensure that management has the broadest possible view of the risk exposures in the India portfolio.

Stosur responds by making the following statements:Statement 1: Unlike mutual fund shares that can be shorted, ETF shares cannot be shorted.Statement 2: In the ETF creation/redemption process, the authorized participants (APs) absorb the costs of transacting securities for the ETF’s portfolio.Statement 3: If ETF shares are trading at a discount to NAV and arbitrage costs are sufficiently low, APs will buy the securities in the creation basket and exchange them for ETF shares from the ETF sponsor.Rutledge notes that one holding, ETF 1, is trading at a premium to its intraday NAV. He reviews the ETF’s pricing and notes that the premium to the intraday NAV is greater than the expected arbitrage costs.Stosur is evaluating three ETFs for potential investment. He notes that the ETFs have different portfolio characteristics that are likely to affect each ETF’s tracking error. A summary of the characteristics for the ETFs is presented in Exhibit 1.

Rutledge and Stosur discuss the factors that influence ETF bid–ask spreads. Stosur tells Rutledge that quoted bid–ask spreads for a particular transaction size are (1) negatively related to the amount of the ongoing order flow in the ETF, (2) positively related to the costs and risks for the ETF liquidity provider, and (3) positively related to the amount of competition among market makers for the ETF.As ETF shares may trade at prices that are different from the NAV, Rutledge examines selected data in Exhibit 2 for three ETFs that might have this problem.

Rutledge and Stosur discuss the factors that influence ETF bid–ask spreads. Stosur tells Rutledge that quoted bid–ask spreads for a particular transaction size are (1) negatively related to the amount of the ongoing order flow in the ETF, (2) positively related to the costs and risks for the ETF liquidity provider, and (3) positively related to the amount of competition among market makers for the ETF.As ETF shares may trade at prices that are different from the NAV, Rutledge examines selected data in Exhibit 2 for three ETFs that might have this problem.

22,"Brian Johnson is a senior manager at Star Asset Management (SAMN), a large asset management firm in the United States. Tim Martin has just earned his advanced degree in statistics and was hired to support the trading team at SAMN. Martin meets with Johnson to undergo a training relating to SAMN's trading activities.Johnson begins the training with a review of the limit order book for Light Systems, Inc., which is presented in Exhibit 1. Three dealers make market for the shares of Light Systems. Based on these prices, SAMN's trading desk executes a market sell order for 1,100 shares of Light Systems.

Johnson then discusses a market buy order for 5,000 shares of an illiquid stock. The order was filled in three trades, and details about the three trades are presented in Exhibit 2.

| 3 | 11.30a.m. | $25.27 | 2，500 | $25.22 | $25.26 |


Johnson explains to Martin that the number of venues trading the same instruments has proliferated in recent years, and trading in any given instrument has now been distributed across these multiple venues. As a result, the available liquidity on any one of those exchanges represents just a small portion of the aggregate liquidity for that security. As a result, SAMN has had to adapt its trading strategies, particularly for large trades.Johnson asks Martin about his views on how the introduction of electronic trading might have impacted SAMN. Martin tells Johnson:Statement 1 Once built, electronic trading systems are more efficient and cheaper to operate than floor-based trading systems.Statement 2 Electronic trading systems have attracted a lot of new buy-side traders, and the increased competition has resulted in narrower bid–ask spreads.Statement 3 The introduction of electronic markets has had a much greater impact on the trading of corporate and municipal bonds than on the trading of equities.Johnson tells Martin that communication speed is SAMN's current highest prior-ity. All of SAMN's competitors have increased their communication speeds in recent months, and Johnson says management wants SAMN to be faster than its competi-tors. SAMN's trading desk is located in a residential area far from downtown where the exchanges it works with are located. SAMN's trading team is relatively large with experienced investment professionals, and the firm recently invested in fast computers with the latest algorithms.At the end of the training, Johnson gives Martin his first assignment. The assign-ment is for Martin to use the vast amount of data that SAMN has collected to design a machine learning (ML) model using advanced statistical methods to characterize data structures and relations. Then he has to build a trading algorithm based on the same model. Since electronic trading has added systemic risk to the market, Johnson asks Martin to suggest ways to minimize the systemic risk introduced by his algorithm. Martin offers two suggestions:Suggestion 1 Perform extensive testing of the algorithm before its launch.Suggestion 2 Impose mandatory trading halts if prices change outside a threshold range.A month into the job, Johnson sends Martin to an investment conference focused on abusive trading practices. Based on what he learned at the conference, Martin recommends to Johnson that SAMN incorporate a new rule that news be validated before a trade triggered by news is executed.

23,"Tina Ming is a senior portfolio manager at Flusk Pension Fund (Flusk). Flusk's portfolio is composed of fixed-income instruments structured to match Flusk's liabilities.Ming works with Shrikant McKee, Flusk's risk analyst. Ming and McKee discuss the latest risk report. McKee calculated value at risk (VaR) for the entire portfolio using the historical method and assuming a lookback period of five years and 250 trading days per year. McKee presents VaR measures in Exhibit 1. ]
| Exhibit 1 | F lusk Portfolio VaR(in$millions) |
| Confidence Interval | Daily VaR | Monthly VaR |
| 95% | 1.10 | 5.37 |


After reading McKee's report, Ming asks why the number of daily VaR breaches over the last year is zero even though the portfolio has accumulated a substantial loss.Next Ming requests that McKee perform the following two risk analyses on Flusk's portfolio:Analysis 1 Use scenario analysis to evaluate the impact on risk and return of a repeat of the last financial crisis.Analysis 2 Estimate over one year, with a 95% level of confidence, how much Flusk's assets could underperform its liabilities.Ming recommends purchasing newly issued emerging market corporate bonds that have embedded options. Prior to buying the bonds, Ming wants McKee to estimate the effect of the purchase on Flusk's VaR. McKee suggests running a stress test using a historical period specific to emerging markets that encompassed an extreme change in credit spreads.At the conclusion of their conversation, Ming asks the following question about risk management tools: “What are the advantages of VaR compared with other risk measures?”
The number of Flusk's VaR breaches most likely resulted from:",using a standard normal distribution in the VaR model.,using a 95% confidence interval instead of a 99% confidence interval.,lower market volatility during the last year compared with the lookback period.,,C

He works with Amy Riley, a junior trader at the company. Bloomfield and Riley meet to review the company’s trading systems and several trades in Bloomfield’s trading account.They discuss the increasing impact of market fragmentation on available liquidity for the company’s trading strategies. Riley makes the following comments regarding market fragmentation:Comment 1: Liquidity aggregation and smart order routing help traders manage the challenges and opportunities presented by fragmentation.Comment 2: With increasing market fragmentation, traders who fill large orders now search for liquidity across multiple venues and across time to control market impact.Bloomfield tells Riley that he noticed trades of 500 shares of BYYP stock were executed every 20 minutes for an hour. Bloomfield saw the same pattern of trading in the stock during the previous trading day. He instructs Riley to submit an order to purchase BYYP shares on the assumption that a trader seeks liquidity and is executing a large buy order by breaking it into pieces. The prices of these trades and the best bids and offers in the market when the BYYP trades occurred are presented in Exhibit 1.

Bloomfield shifts the conversation to AXZ Corp. Bloomfield notes that AXZ’s bid–ask spread is narrow, even though AXZ’s share price has been experiencing a period of high volatility. After extensive research, Bloomfield will purchase AXZ shares using a trading strategy that does not include standing orders.Bloomfield then assesses the risks that 2Fast’s electronic trading strategies introduce into the market. He is concerned that these risks may bring on more regulation. Bloomfield claims that the risks can be reduced by changing the structure of the market, and those structural changes can maintain 2Fast’s primary competitive advantage, which is trading faster than competitors.Bloomfield mentions that a regulatory body is investigating a competitor’s trading practices. The investigation involves a tip that the competitor is manipulating markets by submitting orders and arranging trades to influence other traders’ perceptions of value. Specifically, regulators were informed that the competitor has been buying stock to raise its price, thereby encouraging momentum traders to buy, and then selling the stock to them at higher prices. The regulator confirmed that the competitor did not use standing limit orders or commonly controlled accounts for the trades under investigation.

Kynnersley meets with IMA's portfolio management team and investment advisers to discuss the methods used to measure and manage market risk and how risk metrics are presented in client reports.The three most popular investment funds offered by IMA are the Equity Opportunities, the Diversified Fixed Income, and the Alpha Core Equity. The Equity Opportunities Fund is composed of two exchange-traded funds: a broadly diversi-fied large-cap equity product and one devoted to energy stocks. Kynnersley makes the following statements regarding the risk management policies established for the Equity Opportunities portfolio:Statement 1 IMA's preferred approach to model value at risk (VaR) is to estimate expected returns, volatilities, and correlations under the assumption of a normal distribution.Statement 2 In last year's annual client performance report, IMA stated that a hypothetical $6 million Equity Opportunities Fund account had a daily 5% VaR of approximately 1.5% of portfolio value.Kynnersley informs the investment advisers that the risk management department recently updated the model for estimating the Equity Opportunities Fund VaR based on the information presented in Exhibit 1.

35,"Hiram Life (Hiram), a large multinational insurer located in Canada, has received permission to increase its ownership in an India-based life insurance company, LICIA, from 26% to 49%. Before completing this transaction, Hiram wants to complete a risk assessment of LICIA's investment portfolio. Judith Hamilton, Hiram's chief financial officer, has been asked to brief the management committee on investment risk in its India-based insurance operations.LICIA's portfolio, which has a market value of CAD 260 million, is currently structured as shown in Exhibit 1. Despite its more than 1,000 individual holdings, the portfolio is invested predominantly in India. The Indian government bond market is highly liquid, but the country's mortgage and infrastructure loan markets, as well as the corporate bond market, are relatively illiquid. Individual mortgage and corporate bond positions are large relative to the normal trading volumes in these securities. Given the elevated current and fiscal account deficits, Indian investments are also subject to above-average economic risk.Hamilton begins with a summary of the India-based portfolio. Exhibit 1 presents the current portfolio composition and the risk and return assumptions used to esti?mate value at risk (VaR).

Infrastructure is a rapidly growing asset class with limited return history; the first infrastructure loans were issued just 10 years ago.Hamilton's report to the management committee must outline her assumptions and provide support for the methods she used in her risk assessment. If needed, she will also make recommendations for rebalancing the portfolio to ensure its risk profile is aligned with that of Hiram.Hamilton develops the assumptions shown in Exhibit 2, which will be used for estimating the portfolio VaR.

Hamilton elects to apply a one-day, 5% VaR limit of CAD 2 million in her risk assessment of LICIA,s portfolio. This limit is consistent with the risk tolerance the committee has specified for the Hiram portfolio.The markets' volatility during the last 12 months has been significantly higher than the historical norm, with increased frequency of large daily losses, and Hamilton expects the next 12 months to be equally volatile.She estimates the one-day 5% portfolio VaR for LICIA's portfolio using three different approaches:

The committee is likely to have questions in a number of key areas—the limitations of the VaR report, potential losses in an extreme adverse event, and the reliability of the VaR numbers if the market continues to exhibit higher-than-normal volatility. Hamilton wants to be certain that she has thoroughly evaluated the risks inherent in the LICIA portfolio and compares them with the risks in Hiram's present portfolio.Hamilton believes the possibility of a ratings downgrade on Indian sovereign debt is high and not yet fully reflected in securities prices. If the rating is lowered, many of the portfolio's holdings will no longer meet Hiram's minimum ratings requirement. A downgrade's effect is unlikely to be limited to the government bond portfolio. All asset classes can be expected to be affected to some degree. Hamilton plans to include a scenario analysis that reflects this possibility to ensure that management has the broadest possible view of the risk exposures in the India portfolio.
The scenario analysis that Hamilton prepares for the committee is most likely a:",stress test.,historical scenario.,hypothetical scenario.,,C

Johnson explains to Martin that the number of venues trading the same instruments has proliferated in recent years, and trading in any given instrument has now been distributed across these multiple venues. As a result, the available liquidity on any one of those exchanges represents just a small portion of the aggregate liquidity for that security. As a result, SAMN has had to adapt its trading strategies, particularly for large trades.Johnson asks Martin about his views on how the introduction of electronic trading might have impacted SAMN. Martin tells Johnson:Statement 1 Once built, electronic trading systems are more efficient and cheaper to operate than floor-based trading systems.Statement 2 Electronic trading systems have attracted a lot of new buy-side traders, and the increased competition has resulted in narrower bid–ask spreads.Statement 3 The introduction of electronic markets has had a much greater impact on the trading of corporate and municipal bonds than on the trading of equities.Johnson tells Martin that communication speed is SAMN's current highest prior-ity. All of SAMN's competitors have increased their communication speeds in recent months, and Johnson says management wants SAMN to be faster than its competi-tors. SAMN's trading desk is located in a residential area far from downtown where the exchanges it works with are located. SAMN's trading team is relatively large with experienced investment professionals, and the firm recently invested in fast computers with the latest algorithms.At the end of the training, Johnson gives Martin his first assignment. The assign-ment is for Martin to use the vast amount of data that SAMN has collected to design a machine learning (ML) model using advanced statistical methods to characterize data structures and relations. Then he has to build a trading algorithm based on the same model. Since electronic trading has added systemic risk to the market, Johnson asks Martin to suggest ways to minimize the systemic risk introduced by his algorithm. Martin offers two suggestions:Suggestion 1 Perform extensive testing of the algorithm before its launch.Suggestion 2 Impose mandatory trading halts if prices change outside a threshold range.A month into the job, Johnson sends Martin to an investment conference focused on abusive trading practices. Based on what he learned at the conference, Martin recommends to Johnson that SAMN incorporate a new rule that news be validated before a trade triggered by news is executed.

37,"Carol Kynnersley is the chief risk officer at Investment Management Advisers (IMA). Kynnersley meets with IMA's portfolio management team and investment advisers to discuss the methods used to measure and manage market risk and how risk metrics are presented in client reports.The three most popular investment funds offered by IMA are the Equity Opportunities, the Diversified Fixed Income, and the Alpha Core Equity. The Equity Opportunities Fund is composed of two exchange-traded funds: a broadly diversi-fied large-cap equity product and one devoted to energy stocks. Kynnersley makes the following statements regarding the risk management policies established for the Equity Opportunities portfolio:Statement 1 IMA's preferred approach to model value at risk (VaR) is to estimate expected returns, volatilities, and correlations under the assumption of a normal distribution.Statement 2 In last year's annual client performance report, IMA stated that a hypothetical $6 million Equity Opportunities Fund account had a daily 5% VaR of approximately 1.5% of portfolio value.Kynnersley informs the investment advisers that the risk management department recently updated the model for estimating the Equity Opportunities Fund VaR based on the information presented in Exhibit 1.
| Exhibit 1Equity Opportunities Fund一VaR Model Input Assumptions |
| Large-CapE TF | Energy ETF | Total Portfolio |
| Portfolio weight | 65.0% | 35.0% | 100.0% |

| Standard deviation | 20.0% | 40.0% | 26.3% |
| Correlation between ETFs：0.90 |
| Number of trading days /year： 250 |


For clients interested in fixed-income products, IMA offers the Diversified Fixed-Income Fund. Kynnersley explains that the portfolio's bonds are all subject to interest rate risk. To demonstrate how fixed-income exposure measures can be used to identify and manage interest rate risk, Kynnersley distributes two exhibits featuring three hypothetical Treasury coupon bonds (Exhibit 2) under three interest rate scenarios (Exhibit 3).

| Scenario 3 | Rates decrease 20bps |


One of the investment advisers comments that a client recently asked about the performance of the Diversified Fixed-Income Fund relative to its benchmark, a broad fixed-income index. Kynnersley informs the adviser as follows:Statement 3 The Diversified Fixed-Income Fund manager monitors the historical deviation between portfolio returns and benchmark returns. The fund prospectus stipulates a target deviation from the bench-mark of no more than 5 bps.Kynnersley concludes the meeting by reviewing the constraints IMA imposes on securities included in the Alpha Core Equity Fund. The compliance department conducts daily oversight using numerous risk screens and, when indicated, notifies portfolio managers to make adjustments. Kynnersley makes the following statement:Statement 4 It is important that all clients investing in the fund be made aware of IMA's compliance measures. The Alpha Core Equity Fund restricts the exposure of individual securities to 1.75% of the total portfolio.
In Statement 2, Kynnersley implies that the portfolio:","is at risk of losing $4,500 each trading day.","value is expected to decline by $90,000 or more once in 20 trading days.","has a 5% chance of falling in value by a maximum of $90,000 on a single trading day.",,B

Rutledge meets with recently hired junior analyst Larry Stosur to review the fund’s holdings.Rutledge asks Stosur about the mechanics of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Stosur responds by making the following statements:Statement 1: Unlike mutual fund shares that can be shorted, ETF shares cannot be shorted.Statement 2: In the ETF creation/redemption process, the authorized participants (APs) absorb the costs of transacting securities for the ETF’s portfolio.Statement 3: If ETF shares are trading at a discount to NAV and arbitrage costs are sufficiently low, APs will buy the securities in the creation basket and exchange them for ETF shares from the ETF sponsor.Rutledge notes that one holding, ETF 1, is trading at a premium to its intraday NAV. He reviews the ETF’s pricing and notes that the premium to the intraday NAV is greater than the expected arbitrage costs.Stosur is evaluating three ETFs for potential investment. He notes that the ETFs have different portfolio characteristics that are likely to affect each ETF’s tracking error. A summary of the characteristics for the ETFs is presented in Exhibit 1.

Rutledge and Stosur discuss the factors that influence ETF bid–ask spreads. Stosur tells Rutledge that quoted bid–ask spreads for a particular transaction size are (1) negatively related to the amount of the ongoing order flow in the ETF, (2) positively related to the costs and risks for the ETF liquidity provider, and (3) positively related to the amount of competition among market makers for the ETF.As ETF shares may trade at prices that are different from the NAV, Rutledge examines selected data in Exhibit 2 for three ETFs that might have this problem.

He works with Amy Riley, a junior trader at the company. Bloomfield and Riley meet to review the company’s trading systems and several trades in Bloomfield’s trading account.They discuss the increasing impact of market fragmentation on available liquidity for the company’s trading strategies. Riley makes the following comments regarding market fragmentation:Comment 1: Liquidity aggregation and smart order routing help traders manage the challenges and opportunities presented by fragmentation.Comment 2: With increasing market fragmentation, traders who fill large orders now search for liquidity across multiple venues and across time to control market impact.Bloomfield tells Riley that he noticed trades of 500 shares of BYYP stock were executed every 20 minutes for an hour. Bloomfield saw the same pattern of trading in the stock during the previous trading day. He instructs Riley to submit an order to purchase BYYP shares on the assumption that a trader seeks liquidity and is executing a large buy order by breaking it into pieces. The prices of these trades and the best bids and offers in the market when the BYYP trades occurred are presented in Exhibit 1.

Bloomfield shifts the conversation to AXZ Corp. Bloomfield notes that AXZ’s bid–ask spread is narrow, even though AXZ’s share price has been experiencing a period of high volatility. After extensive research, Bloomfield will purchase AXZ shares using a trading strategy that does not include standing orders.Bloomfield then assesses the risks that 2Fast’s electronic trading strategies introduce into the market. He is concerned that these risks may bring on more regulation. Bloomfield claims that the risks can be reduced by changing the structure of the market, and those structural changes can maintain 2Fast’s primary competitive advantage, which is trading faster than competitors.Bloomfield mentions that a regulatory body is investigating a competitor’s trading practices. The investigation involves a tip that the competitor is manipulating markets by submitting orders and arranging trades to influence other traders’ perceptions of value. Specifically, regulators were informed that the competitor has been buying stock to raise its price, thereby encouraging momentum traders to buy, and then selling the stock to them at higher prices. The regulator confirmed that the competitor did not use standing limit orders or commonly controlled accounts for the trades under investigation.
The competitor company’s trading is best described as:",bluffing.,spoofing.,wash trading.,,A

Hamilton wants to be certain that she has thoroughly evaluated the risks inherent in the LICIA portfolio and compares them with the risks in Hiram's present portfolio.Hamilton believes the possibility of a ratings downgrade on Indian sovereign debt is high and not yet fully reflected in securities prices. If the rating is lowered, many of the portfolio's holdings will no longer meet Hiram's minimum ratings requirement. A downgrade's effect is unlikely to be limited to the government bond portfolio. All asset classes can be expected to be affected to some degree. Hamilton plans to include a scenario analysis that reflects this possibility to ensure that management has the broadest possible view of the risk exposures in the India portfolio.
Given Hamilton's expectations, which of the following models is most appropri?ate to use in estimating portfolio VaR?",Parametric method,Historical simulation method,Monte Carlo simulation method,,C
43,"Brian Johnson is a senior manager at Star Asset Management (SAMN), a large asset management firm in the United States. Tim Martin has just earned his advanced degree in statistics and was hired to support the trading team at SAMN. Martin meets with Johnson to undergo a training relating to SAMN's trading activities.Johnson begins the training with a review of the limit order book for Light Systems, Inc., which is presented in Exhibit 1. Three dealers make market for the shares of Light Systems. Based on these prices, SAMN's trading desk executes a market sell order for 1,100 shares of Light Systems.

Johnson explains to Martin that the number of venues trading the same instruments has proliferated in recent years, and trading in any given instrument has now been distributed across these multiple venues. As a result, the available liquidity on any one of those exchanges represents just a small portion of the aggregate liquidity for that security. As a result, SAMN has had to adapt its trading strategies, particularly for large trades.Johnson asks Martin about his views on how the introduction of electronic trading might have impacted SAMN. Martin tells Johnson:Statement 1 Once built, electronic trading systems are more efficient and cheaper to operate than floor-based trading systems.Statement 2 Electronic trading systems have attracted a lot of new buy-side traders, and the increased competition has resulted in narrower bid–ask spreads.Statement 3 The introduction of electronic markets has had a much greater impact on the trading of corporate and municipal bonds than on the trading of equities.Johnson tells Martin that communication speed is SAMN's current highest prior-ity. All of SAMN's competitors have increased their communication speeds in recent months, and Johnson says management wants SAMN to be faster than its competi-tors. SAMN's trading desk is located in a residential area far from downtown where the exchanges it works with are located. SAMN's trading team is relatively large with experienced investment professionals, and the firm recently invested in fast computers with the latest algorithms.At the end of the training, Johnson gives Martin his first assignment. The assign-ment is for Martin to use the vast amount of data that SAMN has collected to design a machine learning (ML) model using advanced statistical methods to characterize data structures and relations. Then he has to build a trading algorithm based on the same model. Since electronic trading has added systemic risk to the market, Johnson asks Martin to suggest ways to minimize the systemic risk introduced by his algorithm. Martin offers two suggestions:Suggestion 1 Perform extensive testing of the algorithm before its launch.Suggestion 2 Impose mandatory trading halts if prices change outside a threshold range.A month into the job, Johnson sends Martin to an investment conference focused on abusive trading practices. Based on what he learned at the conference, Martin recommends to Johnson that SAMN incorporate a new rule that news be validated before a trade triggered by news is executed.
Which of the following changes should SAMN make to address its key priority?",Hire more investment professionals,Upgrade to more complex operating systems,Move the trading desk physically closer to the exchanges it works with,,C
44,"Carlos Altuve is a manager-of-managers at an investment company that uses quantitative models extensively. Altuve seeks to construct a multi-manager portfolio using some of the funds managed by portfolio managers within the firm. Maya Zapata is assisting him.Altuve uses arbitrage pricing theory (APT) as a basis for evaluating strategies and managing risks. From his earlier analysis, Zapata knows that Funds A and B in Exhibit 1 are well diversified. He has not previously worked with Fund C and is puzzled by the data because it is inconsistent with APT. He asks Zapata gather additional information on Fund C's holdings and to determine if an arbitrage opportunity exists among these three investment alternatives. Her analysis, using the data in Exhibit 1, confirms that an arbitrage opportunity does exist.

The manager of Fund C makes some modifications to his portfolio and eliminates the arbitrage opportunity. Using a two-factor model, Zapata now estimates the three funds'sensitivity to inflation and GDP growth. That information is presented in Exhibit 2. Zapata assumes a zero value for the error terms when working with the selected two-factor model.

Flusk's portfolio is composed of fixed-income instruments structured to match Flusk's liabilities.Ming works with Shrikant McKee, Flusk's risk analyst. Ming and McKee discuss the latest risk report. McKee calculated value at risk (VaR) for the entire portfolio using the historical method and assuming a lookback period of five years and 250 trading days per year. McKee presents VaR measures in Exhibit 1. ]

After reading McKee's report, Ming asks why the number of daily VaR breaches over the last year is zero even though the portfolio has accumulated a substantial loss.Next Ming requests that McKee perform the following two risk analyses on Flusk's portfolio:Analysis 1 Use scenario analysis to evaluate the impact on risk and return of a repeat of the last financial crisis.Analysis 2 Estimate over one year, with a 95% level of confidence, how much Flusk's assets could underperform its liabilities.Ming recommends purchasing newly issued emerging market corporate bonds that have embedded options. Prior to buying the bonds, Ming wants McKee to estimate the effect of the purchase on Flusk's VaR. McKee suggests running a stress test using a historical period specific to emerging markets that encompassed an extreme change in credit spreads.At the conclusion of their conversation, Ming asks the following question about risk management tools: “What are the advantages of VaR compared with other risk measures?”

47,"Emily Yuen is a senior analyst for a consulting firm that specializes in assessing equity strategies using backtesting and simulation techniques. She is working with an assistant, Cameron Ruckey, to develop multifactor portfolio strategies based on nine factors common to the growth style of investing. To do so, Yuen and Ruckey plan to construct nine separate factor portfolios and then use them to create factor-weighted allocation portfolios.Yuen tasks Ruckey with specifying the investment universe and determining the availability of appropriate reporting data in vendor databases. Ruckey selects a vendor database that does not provide point-in-time data, so he adjusts the database to include point-in-time constituent stocks and a reporting lag of four months.Next, Yuen and Ruckey run initial backtests on the nine factor portfolios, calculating performance statistics and key metrics for each. For backtesting purposes, the portfolios are rebalanced monthly over a 30-year time horizon using a rolling-window procedure.Yuen and Ruckey consider a variety of metrics to assess the results of the factor portfolio backtests. Yuen asks Ruckey what can be concluded from the data for three of the factor strategies in Exhibit 1:
| Exhibit 1Back test Metrics for Factor Strategies |
| Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |
| VaR(95%) | (3.9%) | (1.3%) | (8.4%) |
| Standard deviation ofreturns | 2.1% | 1.2% | 4.6% |
| Maximum drawdown | 27.2% | 8.3% | 59.7% |


Ruckey tells Yuen the following:Statement 1: We do not need to consider maximum drawdown, because standard deviation sufficiently characterizes risk.Statement 2: Factor 2 has the highest downside risk.From her professional experience Yuen knows that benchmark and risk parity factor portfolios, in which factors are equally weighted and equally risk weighted, respectively, are popular with institutional and high-net-worth clients. To gain a more complete picture of these investment strategies’ performance, Yuen and Ruckey design a Benchmark Portfolio (A) and a Risk Parity Portfolio (B), and then run two simulation methods to generate investment performance data based on the underlying factor portfolios, assuming 1,000 simulation trials for each approach:Approach 1: Historical simulationApproach 2: Monte Carlo simulation.Yuen and Ruckey discuss the differences between the two approaches and then design the simulations, making key decisions at various steps. During the process, Yuen expresses a number of concerns:Concern 1: Returns from six of the nine factors are correlated.Concern 2: The distribution of Factor 1 returns exhibits excess kurtosis and negative skewness.Concern 3: The number of simulations needed for Approach 1 is larger than the size of the historical dataset.For each approach, Yuen and Ruckey run 1,000 trials to obtain 1,000 returns for Portfolios A and B. To help understand the effect of the skewness and excess kurtosis observed in the Factor 1 returns on the performance of Portfolios A and B, Ruckey suggests simulating an additional 1,000 factor returns using a multivariate skewed Student’s t-distribution, then repeating the Approach 2 simulation.
Based on Concern 2, the Factor 1 strategy is most likely to:",be favored by risk-averse investors.,generate surprises in the form of negative returns.,have return data that line up tightly around a trend line.,,B

He works with Amy Riley, a junior trader at the company. Bloomfield and Riley meet to review the company’s trading systems and several trades in Bloomfield’s trading account.They discuss the increasing impact of market fragmentation on available liquidity for the company’s trading strategies. Riley makes the following comments regarding market fragmentation:Comment 1: Liquidity aggregation and smart order routing help traders manage the challenges and opportunities presented by fragmentation.Comment 2: With increasing market fragmentation, traders who fill large orders now search for liquidity across multiple venues and across time to control market impact.Bloomfield tells Riley that he noticed trades of 500 shares of BYYP stock were executed every 20 minutes for an hour. Bloomfield saw the same pattern of trading in the stock during the previous trading day. He instructs Riley to submit an order to purchase BYYP shares on the assumption that a trader seeks liquidity and is executing a large buy order by breaking it into pieces. The prices of these trades and the best bids and offers in the market when the BYYP trades occurred are presented in Exhibit 1.

Bloomfield shifts the conversation to AXZ Corp. Bloomfield notes that AXZ’s bid–ask spread is narrow, even though AXZ’s share price has been experiencing a period of high volatility. After extensive research, Bloomfield will purchase AXZ shares using a trading strategy that does not include standing orders.Bloomfield then assesses the risks that 2Fast’s electronic trading strategies introduce into the market. He is concerned that these risks may bring on more regulation. Bloomfield claims that the risks can be reduced by changing the structure of the market, and those structural changes can maintain 2Fast’s primary competitive advantage, which is trading faster than competitors.Bloomfield mentions that a regulatory body is investigating a competitor’s trading practices. The investigation involves a tip that the competitor is manipulating markets by submitting orders and arranging trades to influence other traders’ perceptions of value. Specifically, regulators were informed that the competitor has been buying stock to raise its price, thereby encouraging momentum traders to buy, and then selling the stock to them at higher prices. The regulator confirmed that the competitor did not use standing limit orders or commonly controlled accounts for the trades under investigation.

52,"Kata Rom is an equity analyst working for Gimingham Wealth Partners (GWP), a large investment advisory company. Rom meets with Goran Galic, a Canadian private wealth client, to explain investment strategies used by GWP to generate portfolio alpha for its clients.Rom states that GWP is recognized in the Canadian investment industry as a leading factor-based value portfolio manager and describes how GWP creates relevant investment strategies and explains GWP’s backtesting process. Rom notes the following:Statement 1: Using historical data, backtesting approximates a real-life investment process to illustrate the risk–return tradeoff of a particular proposed investment strategy.Statement 2: Backtesting is used almost exclusively by quantitative investment managers and rarely by fundamental investment managers, who are more concerned with information such as forward estimates of company earnings, macroeconomic factors, and intrinsic values.Galic, who is 62 years old, decides to allocate C$2 million (representing 10% of his net worth) to an account with GWP and stipulates that portfolio assets be restricted exclusively to domestic securities. Although GWP has not backtested its strategies with such a restriction, it has backtested its strategies using a global index that includes domestic securities. Rom shows the following risk measures to Galic for three factor portfolios.
| Exhibit 1Downside Risk Measures for Model Factors |
| Risk Measure | Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |
| Value at risk(VaR)(95%) | (6.49%) | (0.77%) | (2.40%) |
| Conditional VaR(CVaR) (95%) | (15.73%) | (4.21%) | (3.24%) |
| Maximum drawdown | 35.10% | 38.83% | 45.98% |


Galic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the following replies:Statement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a weakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in particular may not capture extreme downside risk.Statement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of financial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.In an effort to make Galic fully aware of the risks inherent in GWP’s strategies, Rom describes a recent study that investigated the return distributions of value and momentum factors that GWP uses to construct portfolios. The study found that these distributions were non-normal based on their negative skewness, excess kurtosis, and tail dependence. Rom indicated that investment strategies based on this type of data are prone to significantly higher downside risk. Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as scenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2 compares the performance of two of GWP’s factor allocation strategies in different regimes:
| Exhibit 2Scenario Analysis Using the Sharpe Ratio |
| Strategy/Regime | HighVolatility | LowVolatility | Recession | Non-recession |
| Strategy I | 0.88 | 0.64 | 0.20 | 1.00 |
| Strategy II | 1.56 | 1.60 | 1.76 | 1.52 |


Galic is surprised to see that some of the backtest results are unfavorable. He asks,“Why has GWP not considered strategies that perform better in backtesting?” Galic recently met with Fastlane Wealth Managers, who showed much better performance results. The portfolio manager at Fastlane told Galic that the company selects the top-performing strategies after performing thousands of backtests.

He invests a portion of the inheritance in an annuity that will immediately increase his income by a substantial amount. He enlists Carlisle's help to invest the remaining amount of the inheritance.Blake informs Carlisle he would like some short-term bonds in his portfolio. Carlisle proposes purchasing a one-year domestic government zero-coupon bond. 1t has a face value of $100 and is currently priced at $96.37. Carlisle estimates the one-year real risk-free rate at 1.15% and expects inflation over the next year to be 2.25%.In an effort to provide Blake with some exposure to international markets, Carlisle proposes three countries to look for investment opportunities. Selected data on the three countries are presented in Exhibit 1.

In her analysis, Carlisle observes that the spread between the three-year default- free nominal bond and the default-free real zero-coupon bond in Country #3 is 2.0%.Blake expresses concern that stocks may be currently overvalued in Country #3 given the country's 20-year historical equity index P/E of 16.0. Carlisle comments:I think the equilibrium P/E in Country #3 has increased because of changes in market conditions.Carlisle predicts that Country #3 wil1 slip into a recession next quarter. She thinks it will be short-lived, lasting only 12 months or so, and considers the impact of such a recession on the performance of the country’s stocks and bonds.

Frazee decides to add a fourth offering to his group of funds, Fund W, which will use the same benchmark as in Exhibit 1. Frazee estimates Fund W's information ratio to be 0.35. He is considering adding the following constraint to his portfolio construction model: Fund W would now have maximum over- and underweight constraints of 7% on single-country positions.Frazee conducts a search to hire a manager for the global equity portion of Fund W and identifies three candidates. He asks the candidates to prepare risk and return forecasts relative to Fund W's benchmark based on their investment strategy, with the only constraint being no short selling. Each candidate develops independent annual forecasts with active return projections that are uncorrelated and constructs a portfolio made up of stocks that are diverse both geographically and across economic sectors. Selected data for the three candidates' portfolios are presented in Exhibit 2.

56,"Michael Bloomfield is a trader at 2Fast Trading, a proprietary trading company that uses machine learning and algorithms to execute trades. He works with Amy Riley, a junior trader at the company. Bloomfield and Riley meet to review the company’s trading systems and several trades in Bloomfield’s trading account.They discuss the increasing impact of market fragmentation on available liquidity for the company’s trading strategies. Riley makes the following comments regarding market fragmentation:Comment 1: Liquidity aggregation and smart order routing help traders manage the challenges and opportunities presented by fragmentation.Comment 2: With increasing market fragmentation, traders who fill large orders now search for liquidity across multiple venues and across time to control market impact.Bloomfield tells Riley that he noticed trades of 500 shares of BYYP stock were executed every 20 minutes for an hour. Bloomfield saw the same pattern of trading in the stock during the previous trading day. He instructs Riley to submit an order to purchase BYYP shares on the assumption that a trader seeks liquidity and is executing a large buy order by breaking it into pieces. The prices of these trades and the best bids and offers in the market when the BYYP trades occurred are presented in Exhibit 1.

Bloomfield shifts the conversation to AXZ Corp. Bloomfield notes that AXZ’s bid–ask spread is narrow, even though AXZ’s share price has been experiencing a period of high volatility. After extensive research, Bloomfield will purchase AXZ shares using a trading strategy that does not include standing orders.Bloomfield then assesses the risks that 2Fast’s electronic trading strategies introduce into the market. He is concerned that these risks may bring on more regulation. Bloomfield claims that the risks can be reduced by changing the structure of the market, and those structural changes can maintain 2Fast’s primary competitive advantage, which is trading faster than competitors.Bloomfield mentions that a regulatory body is investigating a competitor’s trading practices. The investigation involves a tip that the competitor is manipulating markets by submitting orders and arranging trades to influence other traders’ perceptions of value. Specifically, regulators were informed that the competitor has been buying stock to raise its price, thereby encouraging momentum traders to buy, and then selling the stock to them at higher prices. The regulator confirmed that the competitor did not use standing limit orders or commonly controlled accounts for the trades under investigation.
Bloomfield’s strategy to purchase BYYP shares is best classified as electronic:",arbitrage.,front running.,quote matching.,,B

58,"Randy Gorver, chief risk officer at Eastern Regional Bank, and John Abell, assistant risk officer, are currently conducting a risk assessment of several of the bank's independent investment functions. These reviews include the bank's fixed-income investment portfolio and an equity fund managed by the bank's trust department. Gorver and Abell are also assessing Eastern Regional's overall risk exposure.Eastern Regional Bank Fixed-Income Investment PortfolioThe bank's proprietary fixed-income portfolio is structured as a barbell portfolio: About half of the portfolio is invested in zero-coupon Treasuries with maturities in the 3- to 5-year range (Portfolio P1), and the remainder is invested in zero-coupon Treasuries with maturities in the 10- to 15-year range (Portfolio P2. Georges Montes, the portfolio manager, has discretion to allocate between 40% and 60% of the assets to each maturity “bucket” He must remain fully invested at all times. Exhibit 1 shows details of this portfolio.

Trust Department's Equity Funda) Use of Options: The trust department of Eastern Regional Bank manages an equity fund called the Index Plus Fund, with $325 million in assets. This fund's objective is to track the S&P 500 Index price return while producing an income return 1.5 times that of the S&P 500. The bank's chief investment officer (CIO) uses put and call options on S&P 500 stock index futures to adjust the risk exposure of certain client accounts that have an investment in this fund. The portfolio of a 60-year-old widow with a below-average risk tolerance has an investment in this fund, and the CIO has asked his assistant, Janet Ferrell, to propose an options strategy to bring the portfolio's delta to 0.90.b) Value at Risk: The Index Plus Fund has a one-day 95% value at risk (VaR) of $6.5 million. Gorver asks Abell to write a brief summary of the portfolio VaR for the report he is preparing on the fund's risk position.Combined Bank Risk ExposuresThe bank has adopted a new risk policy, which requires forward-looking risk assessments in addition to the measures that look at historical risk characteristics. Management has also become very focused on tail risk since the subprime crisis and is evaluating the bank's capital allocation to certain higher-risk lines of business. Gorver must determine what additional risk metrics to include in his risk reporting to address the new policy. He asks Abell to draft a section of the risk report that will address the risk measures' adequacy for capital allocation decisions.
Which of the following statements should not be included in Abell's report to management regarding the use of risk measures in capital allocation decisions?",VaR measures capture the increased liquidity risk during stress periods.,Stress tests and scenario analysis can be used to evaluate the effect of outlier events on each line of business.,VaR approaches that can accommodate a non-normal distribution are criti?cal to understand relative risk across lines of business.,,A
59,"Julie Carlisle is a financial planner at a large wealth management firm. One of her clients, Esteban Blake, just received a sizable inheritance. He invests a portion of the inheritance in an annuity that will immediately increase his income by a substantial amount. He enlists Carlisle's help to invest the remaining amount of the inheritance.Blake informs Carlisle he would like some short-term bonds in his portfolio. Carlisle proposes purchasing a one-year domestic government zero-coupon bond. 1t has a face value of $100 and is currently priced at $96.37. Carlisle estimates the one-year real risk-free rate at 1.15% and expects inflation over the next year to be 2.25%.In an effort to provide Blake with some exposure to international markets, Carlisle proposes three countries to look for investment opportunities. Selected data on the three countries are presented in Exhibit 1.

| Country # 2 | 5.0% | 2.5% | High | Upward slope | 17.3 |
| Country # 3 | 3.5% | 2.0% | Low | Flat | 18.2 |


In her analysis, Carlisle observes that the spread between the three-year default- free nominal bond and the default-free real zero-coupon bond in Country #3 is 2.0%.Blake expresses concern that stocks may be currently overvalued in Country #3 given the country's 20-year historical equity index P/E of 16.0. Carlisle comments:I think the equilibrium P/E in Country #3 has increased because of changes in market conditions.Carlisle predicts that Country #3 wil1 slip into a recession next quarter. She thinks it will be short-lived, lasting only 12 months or so, and considers the impact of such a recession on the performance of the country’s stocks and bonds.

60,"Hiram Life (Hiram), a large multinational insurer located in Canada, has received permission to increase its ownership in an India-based life insurance company, LICIA, from 26% to 49%. Before completing this transaction, Hiram wants to complete a risk assessment of LICIA's investment portfolio. Judith Hamilton, Hiram's chief financial officer, has been asked to brief the management committee on investment risk in its India-based insurance operations.LICIA's portfolio, which has a market value of CAD 260 million, is currently structured as shown in Exhibit 1. Despite its more than 1,000 individual holdings, the portfolio is invested predominantly in India. The Indian government bond market is highly liquid, but the country's mortgage and infrastructure loan markets, as well as the corporate bond market, are relatively illiquid. Individual mortgage and corporate bond positions are large relative to the normal trading volumes in these securities. Given the elevated current and fiscal account deficits, Indian investments are also subject to above-average economic risk.Hamilton begins with a summary of the India-based portfolio. Exhibit 1 presents the current portfolio composition and the risk and return assumptions used to esti?mate value at risk (VaR).
| Exhibit l.Selected Assumptions for LICIA's Investment Portfolio |
| Allocation | Average Daily | Daily Standard |
| Return | Deviation |
| India govemment securities | 50% | 0.015% | 0.206% |
| India mortgage/infrastructure loans | 25% | 0.045% | 0.710% |
| India corporate bonds | 15% | 0.025% | 0.324% |
| India equity | 10% | 0.035% | 0.996% |


Infrastructure is a rapidly growing asset class with limited return history; the first infrastructure loans were issued just 10 years ago.Hamilton's report to the management committee must outline her assumptions and provide support for the methods she used in her risk assessment. If needed, she will also make recommendations for rebalancing the portfolio to ensure its risk profile is aligned with that of Hiram.Hamilton develops the assumptions shown in Exhibit 2, which will be used for estimating the portfolio VaR.
| Exhibit 2VaR Input Assumptions for Proposed CAD260Mllion Portfolio |
| Method | Average Return | Standard Deviation |
| Assumption | Assumption |
| MonteCarlo simulation | 0.026% | 0.501% |
| Para metic approach | 0.026% | 0.501% |
| Historical simulation | 0.023% | 0.490% |


Hamilton elects to apply a one-day, 5% VaR limit of CAD 2 million in her risk assessment of LICIA,s portfolio. This limit is consistent with the risk tolerance the committee has specified for the Hiram portfolio.The markets' volatility during the last 12 months has been significantly higher than the historical norm, with increased frequency of large daily losses, and Hamilton expects the next 12 months to be equally volatile.She estimates the one-day 5% portfolio VaR for LICIA's portfolio using three different approaches:
| Exhibit 3VaR Results over a One-Day Period for Proposed Portfolio |
| Method | 5%VaR |
| MonteCarlo simulation | CAD 2， 095， 565 |
| Parametric approach | CAD 2， 083， 610 |
| Historic simulation | CAD 1， 938， 874 |


The committee is likely to have questions in a number of key areas—the limitations of the VaR report, potential losses in an extreme adverse event, and the reliability of the VaR numbers if the market continues to exhibit higher-than-normal volatility. Hamilton wants to be certain that she has thoroughly evaluated the risks inherent in the LICIA portfolio and compares them with the risks in Hiram's present portfolio.Hamilton believes the possibility of a ratings downgrade on Indian sovereign debt is high and not yet fully reflected in securities prices. If the rating is lowered, many of the portfolio's holdings will no longer meet Hiram's minimum ratings requirement. A downgrade's effect is unlikely to be limited to the government bond portfolio. All asset classes can be expected to be affected to some degree. Hamilton plans to include a scenario analysis that reflects this possibility to ensure that management has the broadest possible view of the risk exposures in the India portfolio.
The scenario analysis that Hamilton prepares for the committee is a valuable tool to supplement VaR because it:",incorporates historical data to evaluate the risk in the tail of the VaR distribution.,enables Hamilton to isolate the risk stemming from a single risk factor—the ratings downgrade.,allows the committee to assess the effect of low liquidity in the event of a ratings downgrade.,,C
61,"Emily Yuen is a senior analyst for a consulting firm that specializes in assessing equity strategies using backtesting and simulation techniques. She is working with an assistant, Cameron Ruckey, to develop multifactor portfolio strategies based on nine factors common to the growth style of investing. To do so, Yuen and Ruckey plan to construct nine separate factor portfolios and then use them to create factor-weighted allocation portfolios.Yuen tasks Ruckey with specifying the investment universe and determining the availability of appropriate reporting data in vendor databases. Ruckey selects a vendor database that does not provide point-in-time data, so he adjusts the database to include point-in-time constituent stocks and a reporting lag of four months.Next, Yuen and Ruckey run initial backtests on the nine factor portfolios, calculating performance statistics and key metrics for each. For backtesting purposes, the portfolios are rebalanced monthly over a 30-year time horizon using a rolling-window procedure.Yuen and Ruckey consider a variety of metrics to assess the results of the factor portfolio backtests. Yuen asks Ruckey what can be concluded from the data for three of the factor strategies in Exhibit 1:
| Exhibit 1Back test Metrics for Factor Strategies |
| Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |
| VaR(95%) | (3.9%) | (1.3%) | (8.4%) |
| Standard deviation ofreturns | 2.1% | 1.2% | 4.6% |
| Maximum drawdown | 27.2% | 8.3% | 59.7% |


Ruckey tells Yuen the following:Statement 1: We do not need to consider maximum drawdown, because standard deviation sufficiently characterizes risk.Statement 2: Factor 2 has the highest downside risk.From her professional experience Yuen knows that benchmark and risk parity factor portfolios, in which factors are equally weighted and equally risk weighted, respectively, are popular with institutional and high-net-worth clients. To gain a more complete picture of these investment strategies’ performance, Yuen and Ruckey design a Benchmark Portfolio (A) and a Risk Parity Portfolio (B), and then run two simulation methods to generate investment performance data based on the underlying factor portfolios, assuming 1,000 simulation trials for each approach:Approach 1: Historical simulationApproach 2: Monte Carlo simulation.Yuen and Ruckey discuss the differences between the two approaches and then design the simulations, making key decisions at various steps. During the process, Yuen expresses a number of concerns:Concern 1: Returns from six of the nine factors are correlated.Concern 2: The distribution of Factor 1 returns exhibits excess kurtosis and negative skewness.Concern 3: The number of simulations needed for Approach 1 is larger than the size of the historical dataset.For each approach, Yuen and Ruckey run 1,000 trials to obtain 1,000 returns for Portfolios A and B. To help understand the effect of the skewness and excess kurtosis observed in the Factor 1 returns on the performance of Portfolios A and B, Ruckey suggests simulating an additional 1,000 factor returns using a multivariate skewed Student’s t-distribution, then repeating the Approach 2 simulation.
Based on Exhibit 1, Ruckey should conclude that:",Factor Strategy 3 has the highest portfolio turnover.,Factor Strategy 2 has less downside risk than Strategy 3.,Factor Strategy 2 has the highest returns.,,B

To gain a more complete picture of these investment strategies’ performance, Yuen and Ruckey design a Benchmark Portfolio (A) and a Risk Parity Portfolio (B), and then run two simulation methods to generate investment performance data based on the underlying factor portfolios, assuming 1,000 simulation trials for each approach:Approach 1: Historical simulationApproach 2: Monte Carlo simulation.Yuen and Ruckey discuss the differences between the two approaches and then design the simulations, making key decisions at various steps. During the process, Yuen expresses a number of concerns:Concern 1: Returns from six of the nine factors are correlated.Concern 2: The distribution of Factor 1 returns exhibits excess kurtosis and negative skewness.Concern 3: The number of simulations needed for Approach 1 is larger than the size of the historical dataset.For each approach, Yuen and Ruckey run 1,000 trials to obtain 1,000 returns for Portfolios A and B. To help understand the effect of the skewness and excess kurtosis observed in the Factor 1 returns on the performance of Portfolios A and B, Ruckey suggests simulating an additional 1,000 factor returns using a multivariate skewed Student’s t-distribution, then repeating the Approach 2 simulation.
Simulation Approach 1 (historical simulation) differs from Approach 2 (Monte Carlo simulation) in that:",it is deterministic.,a functional form of the statistical distribution for each decision variable needs to be specified.,it assumes that sampling the returns from the actual data provides sufficient guidance about future asset returns.,,C
65,"Emily Yuen is a senior analyst for a consulting firm that specializes in assessing equity strategies using backtesting and simulation techniques. She is working with an assistant, Cameron Ruckey, to develop multifactor portfolio strategies based on nine factors common to the growth style of investing. To do so, Yuen and Ruckey plan to construct nine separate factor portfolios and then use them to create factor-weighted allocation portfolios.Yuen tasks Ruckey with specifying the investment universe and determining the availability of appropriate reporting data in vendor databases. Ruckey selects a vendor database that does not provide point-in-time data, so he adjusts the database to include point-in-time constituent stocks and a reporting lag of four months.Next, Yuen and Ruckey run initial backtests on the nine factor portfolios, calculating performance statistics and key metrics for each. For backtesting purposes, the portfolios are rebalanced monthly over a 30-year time horizon using a rolling-window procedure.Yuen and Ruckey consider a variety of metrics to assess the results of the factor portfolio backtests. Yuen asks Ruckey what can be concluded from the data for three of the factor strategies in Exhibit 1:
| Exhibit 1Back test Metrics for Factor Strategies |
| Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |
| VaR(95%) | (3.9%) | (1.3%) | (8.4%) |
| Standard deviation ofreturns | 2.1% | 1.2% | 4.6% |
| Maximum drawdown | 27.2% | 8.3% | 59.7% |


Ruckey tells Yuen the following:Statement 1: We do not need to consider maximum drawdown, because standard deviation sufficiently characterizes risk.Statement 2: Factor 2 has the highest downside risk.From her professional experience Yuen knows that benchmark and risk parity factor portfolios, in which factors are equally weighted and equally risk weighted, respectively, are popular with institutional and high-net-worth clients.

66,"Kata Rom is an equity analyst working for Gimingham Wealth Partners (GWP), a large investment advisory company. Rom meets with Goran Galic, a Canadian private wealth client, to explain investment strategies used by GWP to generate portfolio alpha for its clients.Rom states that GWP is recognized in the Canadian investment industry as a leading factor-based value portfolio manager and describes how GWP creates relevant investment strategies and explains GWP’s backtesting process. Rom notes the following:Statement 1: Using historical data, backtesting approximates a real-life investment process to illustrate the risk–return tradeoff of a particular proposed investment strategy.Statement 2: Backtesting is used almost exclusively by quantitative investment managers and rarely by fundamental investment managers, who are more concerned with information such as forward estimates of company earnings, macroeconomic factors, and intrinsic values.Galic, who is 62 years old, decides to allocate C$2 million (representing 10% of his net worth) to an account with GWP and stipulates that portfolio assets be restricted exclusively to domestic securities. Although GWP has not backtested its strategies with such a restriction, it has backtested its strategies using a global index that includes domestic securities. Rom shows the following risk measures to Galic for three factor portfolios.
| Exhibit 1Downside Risk Measures for Model Factors |
| Risk Measure | Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |
| Value at risk(VaR)(95%) | (6.49%) | (0.77%) | (2.40%) |
| Conditional VaR(CVaR) (95%) | (15.73%) | (4.21%) | (3.24%) |
| Maximum drawdown | 35.10% | 38.83% | 45.98% |


Galic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the following replies:Statement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a weakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in particular may not capture extreme downside risk.Statement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of financial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.In an effort to make Galic fully aware of the risks inherent in GWP’s strategies, Rom describes a recent study that investigated the return distributions of value and momentum factors that GWP uses to construct portfolios. The study found that these distributions were non-normal based on their negative skewness, excess kurtosis, and tail dependence. Rom indicated that investment strategies based on this type of data are prone to significantly higher downside risk. Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as scenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2 compares the performance of two of GWP’s factor allocation strategies in different regimes:
| Exhibit 2Scenario Analysis Using the Sharpe Ratio |
| Strategy/Regime | HighVolatility | LowVolatility | Recession | Non-recession |
| Strategy I | 0.88 | 0.64 | 0.20 | 1.00 |
| Strategy II | 1.56 | 1.60 | 1.76 | 1.52 |


Galic is surprised to see that some of the backtest results are unfavorable. He asks,“Why has GWP not considered strategies that perform better in backtesting?” Galic recently met with Fastlane Wealth Managers, who showed much better performance results. The portfolio manager at Fastlane told Galic that the company selects the top-performing strategies after performing thousands of backtests.
Comparing the two strategies in Exhibit 2, the best risk-adjusted performance is demonstrated by:",Strategy II in periods of low volatility and recession.,Strategy I in periods of high volatility and non-recession.,Strategy II in periods of high volatility and non-recession.,,A

Johnson explains to Martin that the number of venues trading the same instruments has proliferated in recent years, and trading in any given instrument has now been distributed across these multiple venues. As a result, the available liquidity on any one of those exchanges represents just a small portion of the aggregate liquidity for that security. As a result, SAMN has had to adapt its trading strategies, particularly for large trades.Johnson asks Martin about his views on how the introduction of electronic trading might have impacted SAMN. Martin tells Johnson:Statement 1 Once built, electronic trading systems are more efficient and cheaper to operate than floor-based trading systems.Statement 2 Electronic trading systems have attracted a lot of new buy-side traders, and the increased competition has resulted in narrower bid–ask spreads.Statement 3 The introduction of electronic markets has had a much greater impact on the trading of corporate and municipal bonds than on the trading of equities.Johnson tells Martin that communication speed is SAMN's current highest prior-ity. All of SAMN's competitors have increased their communication speeds in recent months, and Johnson says management wants SAMN to be faster than its competi-tors. SAMN's trading desk is located in a residential area far from downtown where the exchanges it works with are located. SAMN's trading team is relatively large with experienced investment professionals, and the firm recently invested in fast computers with the latest algorithms.At the end of the training, Johnson gives Martin his first assignment. The assign-ment is for Martin to use the vast amount of data that SAMN has collected to design a machine learning (ML) model using advanced statistical methods to characterize data structures and relations. Then he has to build a trading algorithm based on the same model. Since electronic trading has added systemic risk to the market, Johnson asks Martin to suggest ways to minimize the systemic risk introduced by his algorithm. Martin offers two suggestions:Suggestion 1 Perform extensive testing of the algorithm before its launch.Suggestion 2 Impose mandatory trading halts if prices change outside a threshold range.A month into the job, Johnson sends Martin to an investment conference focused on abusive trading practices. Based on what he learned at the conference, Martin recommends to Johnson that SAMN incorporate a new rule that news be validated before a trade triggered by news is executed.

68,"Hiram Life (Hiram), a large multinational insurer located in Canada, has received permission to increase its ownership in an India-based life insurance company, LICIA, from 26% to 49%. Before completing this transaction, Hiram wants to complete a risk assessment of LICIA's investment portfolio. Judith Hamilton, Hiram's chief financial officer, has been asked to brief the management committee on investment risk in its India-based insurance operations.LICIA's portfolio, which has a market value of CAD 260 million, is currently structured as shown in Exhibit 1. Despite its more than 1,000 individual holdings, the portfolio is invested predominantly in India. The Indian government bond market is highly liquid, but the country's mortgage and infrastructure loan markets, as well as the corporate bond market, are relatively illiquid. Individual mortgage and corporate bond positions are large relative to the normal trading volumes in these securities. Given the elevated current and fiscal account deficits, Indian investments are also subject to above-average economic risk.Hamilton begins with a summary of the India-based portfolio. Exhibit 1 presents the current portfolio composition and the risk and return assumptions used to esti?mate value at risk (VaR).
| Exhibit l.Selected Assumptions for LICIA's Investment Portfolio |
| Allocation | Average Daily | Daily Standard |
| Return | Deviation |
| India govemment securities | 50% | 0.015% | 0.206% |
| India mortgage/infrastructure loans | 25% | 0.045% | 0.710% |
| India corporate bonds | 15% | 0.025% | 0.324% |
| India equity | 10% | 0.035% | 0.996% |


Infrastructure is a rapidly growing asset class with limited return history; the first infrastructure loans were issued just 10 years ago.Hamilton's report to the management committee must outline her assumptions and provide support for the methods she used in her risk assessment. If needed, she will also make recommendations for rebalancing the portfolio to ensure its risk profile is aligned with that of Hiram.Hamilton develops the assumptions shown in Exhibit 2, which will be used for estimating the portfolio VaR.
| Exhibit 2VaR Input Assumptions for Proposed CAD260Mllion Portfolio |
| Method | Average Return | Standard Deviation |
| Assumption | Assumption |
| MonteCarlo simulation | 0.026% | 0.501% |
| Para metic approach | 0.026% | 0.501% |
| Historical simulation | 0.023% | 0.490% |


Hamilton elects to apply a one-day, 5% VaR limit of CAD 2 million in her risk assessment of LICIA,s portfolio. This limit is consistent with the risk tolerance the committee has specified for the Hiram portfolio.The markets' volatility during the last 12 months has been significantly higher than the historical norm, with increased frequency of large daily losses, and Hamilton expects the next 12 months to be equally volatile.She estimates the one-day 5% portfolio VaR for LICIA's portfolio using three different approaches:
| Exhibit 3VaR Results over a One-Day Period for Proposed Portfolio |
| Method | 5%VaR |
| MonteCarlo simulation | CAD 2， 095， 565 |
| Parametric approach | CAD 2， 083， 610 |
| Historic simulation | CAD 1， 938， 874 |


The committee is likely to have questions in a number of key areas—the limitations of the VaR report, potential losses in an extreme adverse event, and the reliability of the VaR numbers if the market continues to exhibit higher-than-normal volatility. Hamilton wants to be certain that she has thoroughly evaluated the risks inherent in the LICIA portfolio and compares them with the risks in Hiram's present portfolio.Hamilton believes the possibility of a ratings downgrade on Indian sovereign debt is high and not yet fully reflected in securities prices. If the rating is lowered, many of the portfolio's holdings will no longer meet Hiram's minimum ratings requirement. A downgrade's effect is unlikely to be limited to the government bond portfolio. All asset classes can be expected to be affected to some degree. Hamilton plans to include a scenario analysis that reflects this possibility to ensure that management has the broadest possible view of the risk exposures in the India portfolio.
Which risk measure is Hamilton most likely to present when addressing the committee's concerns regarding potential losses in extreme stress events?",Relative VaR,Incremental VaR,Conditional VaR,,C
69,"Tina Ming is a senior portfolio manager at Flusk Pension Fund (Flusk). Flusk's portfolio is composed of fixed-income instruments structured to match Flusk's liabilities.Ming works with Shrikant McKee, Flusk's risk analyst. Ming and McKee discuss the latest risk report. McKee calculated value at risk (VaR) for the entire portfolio using the historical method and assuming a lookback period of five years and 250 trading days per year. McKee presents VaR measures in Exhibit 1. ]
| Exhibit 1 | F lusk Portfolio VaR(in$millions) |
| Confidence Interval | Daily VaR | Monthly VaR |
| 95% | 1.10 | 5.37 |


After reading McKee's report, Ming asks why the number of daily VaR breaches over the last year is zero even though the portfolio has accumulated a substantial loss.Next Ming requests that McKee perform the following two risk analyses on Flusk's portfolio:Analysis 1 Use scenario analysis to evaluate the impact on risk and return of a repeat of the last financial crisis.Analysis 2 Estimate over one year, with a 95% level of confidence, how much Flusk's assets could underperform its liabilities.Ming recommends purchasing newly issued emerging market corporate bonds that have embedded options. Prior to buying the bonds, Ming wants McKee to estimate the effect of the purchase on Flusk's VaR. McKee suggests running a stress test using a historical period specific to emerging markets that encompassed an extreme change in credit spreads.At the conclusion of their conversation, Ming asks the following question about risk management tools: “What are the advantages of VaR compared with other risk measures?”
The estimate requested in Analysis 2 is best described as:",liquidity gap.,surplus at risk.,maximum drawdown.,,B

He works with Amy Riley, a junior trader at the company. Bloomfield and Riley meet to review the company’s trading systems and several trades in Bloomfield’s trading account.They discuss the increasing impact of market fragmentation on available liquidity for the company’s trading strategies. Riley makes the following comments regarding market fragmentation:Comment 1: Liquidity aggregation and smart order routing help traders manage the challenges and opportunities presented by fragmentation.Comment 2: With increasing market fragmentation, traders who fill large orders now search for liquidity across multiple venues and across time to control market impact.Bloomfield tells Riley that he noticed trades of 500 shares of BYYP stock were executed every 20 minutes for an hour. Bloomfield saw the same pattern of trading in the stock during the previous trading day. He instructs Riley to submit an order to purchase BYYP shares on the assumption that a trader seeks liquidity and is executing a large buy order by breaking it into pieces. The prices of these trades and the best bids and offers in the market when the BYYP trades occurred are presented in Exhibit 1.

Bloomfield shifts the conversation to AXZ Corp. Bloomfield notes that AXZ’s bid–ask spread is narrow, even though AXZ’s share price has been experiencing a period of high volatility. After extensive research, Bloomfield will purchase AXZ shares using a trading strategy that does not include standing orders.Bloomfield then assesses the risks that 2Fast’s electronic trading strategies introduce into the market. He is concerned that these risks may bring on more regulation. Bloomfield claims that the risks can be reduced by changing the structure of the market, and those structural changes can maintain 2Fast’s primary competitive advantage, which is trading faster than competitors.Bloomfield mentions that a regulatory body is investigating a competitor’s trading practices. The investigation involves a tip that the competitor is manipulating markets by submitting orders and arranging trades to influence other traders’ perceptions of value. Specifically, regulators were informed that the competitor has been buying stock to raise its price, thereby encouraging momentum traders to buy, and then selling the stock to them at higher prices. The regulator confirmed that the competitor did not use standing limit orders or commonly controlled accounts for the trades under investigation.
Which structural change for the market associated with electronic trading systems is most consistent with Bloomfield’s claim?",Delaying order processing by random intervals.,Exchanges using trade halts when prices move too quickly.,Slowing markets by running call markets once a second or more often instead of trading continuously.,,B

Rom notes the following:Statement 1: Using historical data, backtesting approximates a real-life investment process to illustrate the risk–return tradeoff of a particular proposed investment strategy.Statement 2: Backtesting is used almost exclusively by quantitative investment managers and rarely by fundamental investment managers, who are more concerned with information such as forward estimates of company earnings, macroeconomic factors, and intrinsic values.Galic, who is 62 years old, decides to allocate C$2 million (representing 10% of his net worth) to an account with GWP and stipulates that portfolio assets be restricted exclusively to domestic securities. Although GWP has not backtested its strategies with such a restriction, it has backtested its strategies using a global index that includes domestic securities. Rom shows the following risk measures to Galic for three factor portfolios.
| Exhibit 1Downside Risk Measures for Model Factors |
| Risk Measure | Factor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 |
| Value at risk(VaR)(95%) | (6.49%) | (0.77%) | (2.40%) |
| Conditional VaR(CVaR) (95%) | (15.73%) | (4.21%) | (3.24%) |
| Maximum drawdown | 35.10% | 38.83% | 45.98% |


Galic asks Rom, “What happens if the future is different from the past?” Rom gives the following replies:Statement 3: Although backtesting can offer some comfort, you are correct that it does have a weakness: Backtesting generally does not capture the dynamic nature of financial markets and in particular may not capture extreme downside risk.Statement 4: As a result, we have captured extreme downside risk and the dynamic nature of financial markets by using the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at- Risk measures.In an effort to make Galic fully aware of the risks inherent in GWP’s strategies, Rom describes a recent study that investigated the return distributions of value and momentum factors that GWP uses to construct portfolios. The study found that these distributions were non-normal based on their negative skewness, excess kurtosis, and tail dependence. Rom indicated that investment strategies based on this type of data are prone to significantly higher downside risk. Rom informs Galic that GWP also uses a technique commonly referred to as scenario analysis to examine how strategies perform in different structural regimes. Exhibit 2 compares the performance of two of GWP’s factor allocation strategies in different regimes:
| Exhibit 2Scenario Analysis Using the Sharpe Ratio |
| Strategy/Regime | HighVolatility | LowVolatility | Recession | Non-recession |
| Strategy I | 0.88 | 0.64 | 0.20 | 1.00 |
| Strategy II | 1.56 | 1.60 | 1.76 | 1.52 |


Galic is surprised to see that some of the backtest results are unfavorable. He asks,“Why has GWP not considered strategies that perform better in backtesting?” Galic recently met with Fastlane Wealth Managers, who showed much better performance results. The portfolio manager at Fastlane told Galic that the company selects the top-performing strategies after performing thousands of backtests.
Galic’s concern embedded in the question “What happens if the future is different from the past?” is a problem most relevant for which investment strategy evaluation technique?",Sensitivity analysis.,Backtesting.,Monte Carlo simulation.,,B
